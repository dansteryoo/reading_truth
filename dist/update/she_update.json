		"devo_summary": "BY Raechel Myers\nWe all have that friend who is a skilled and elaborate storyteller. For them, context is everything and colorful details rule the day. Many of us also have that friend who’s known—and appreciated—for getting to the point. For them, the economy of words is more prized than a creative delivery. They’re direct because they value your time, yet somehow are just as engaging. What they have to say is always worth the listen.  \nThis is one of the things I appreciate about the book of Mark. He hits the ground running! This first chapter alone includes at least ten significant plot points of Jesus’s life, all connected with words like “immediately” and “right away.” There’s an efficiency to Mark’s message that tells me there’s no time to spare. The gospel is urgent, and there is so much he wants his readers to know about the Christ he loves and follows.\nStill, amid the rapid-fire storyline of the first chapter of Mark, the moments of stillness have a way of standing out. Juxtaposing all the noisy action on the page, Jesus retreats to the wilderness (v.12), silences an unclean spirit (v.25), forbids the demons from speaking (v.34), goes away to a deserted place to pray (v.35), tells the healed man to keep quiet (vv.43–44), and ultimately begins preaching in deserted places (v.45). These many instances of quiet become too loud to ignore on a page with so much activity.\nMark doesn’t waste words. From the very first line, he gets straight to the point: Jesus Christ is “the Son of God” (v.1). Later, God Himself addresses Jesus as His “beloved Son” (v.11), and even the unclean spirit says to Jesus, “I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” (v.24). \nI’m a person who appreciates efficiency, so you can see why the book of Mark appeals to me. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t tender to my heart as well. “This is why I have come,” Jesus tells His disciples (v.38). Not to be flashy, not to draw big crowds, but to preach the gospel and bring the kingdom with a contagious holiness that could drive out demons and heal the sick. Yes, there is a lot of action, but the theme and thrust are clear, spoken from the lips of Christ Himself: “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!” (v.15).\nAs we begin this journey through the Gospel of Mark, let’s pay attention to the inspired, intentional way this very unique book was written. But let’s not forget to also engage our hearts, remembering Christ’s simple call to “repent and believe” that the gospel is true. It is good news, and it is for all of us.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nDo you remember middle school lunch, when the table you sat at said so much about who you were? Like a predictable scene from a tween television series, popular kids sat at one table and theatre kids sat at another. Everyone sought “coolness” and thought “geekiness” could be caught like a cold. But in those shows, there’s always one heroic character who breaks the status quo, mixes up the social groups, and earns the respect and praise of their peers. In reality, though, failing to stick to the status quo doesn’t always get applause. And for Jesus, it was downright dangerous.\nDuring Jesus’s ministry, a religious group known as the Pharisees were considered the “cool kids,” so to speak. They were devoted to the Mosaic Law, so much so that they added more restrictions and limits in an attempt to get people to follow their interpretation of how to pursue holiness. As respected keepers of these laws, the Pharisees created a holiness hierarchy where they sat supreme. So, you can imagine their frustration and confusion when Jesus entered the scene and associated with known sinners, forgiving them of their sins.\nOn one occasion, the Pharisees caught Jesus dining at a table with tax collectors and sinners and asked why He would align Himself with this group of people—as if being a tax collector or a sinner might somehow rub off on Jesus. The Pharisees could not understand why Jesus spent time with those people instead of “holy” people. They completely missed the grace of true forgiveness He came to offer. \nIt’s so easy to think like a Pharisee. I can get caught up in my own self-righteousness, deciding who is most worthy of forgiveness based on my standards. Thankfully, Jesus sees what we cannot: the heart. He said, “I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17). And anyone who receives Jesus also receives “the right to be children of God” (John 1:12). \nUnlike a school hierarchy of popularity, or a Pharisaical hierarchy of holiness, Jesus is not ashamed to call us His brother or sister (Hebrews 2:12). He doesn’t need our attempts to appear righteous. His righteousness extended to us is enough. Despite knowing all the ways we fail Him, He forgives. \nWhat matters is that Christ is proclaimed for who He is and what He has done. He is the Savior who came to forgive and heal and make us more like Him. It is His work that makes us worthy of His presence. Now, we are defined by an invitation to sit at His table, where all are welcome. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Sharon Hodde Miller\nA couple years ago, I received a message from a reader who had just finished my first book. She wrote to thank me, explaining that my book had helped her to heal her marriage. I was grateful, but also a little confused. My book had not addressed anything remotely related to that!\nNot long after, I received a message from another reader, expressing her own gratitude. My book had helped her to grieve a terrible loss, and while I was again honored, I was also perplexed. My book had nothing to do with grief.\nWhat I was experiencing was a phenomenon that every writer, every preacher, every evangelist, and every human being who speaks the Word of God to another has experienced. So long as we proclaim God’s Word, He will use it to communicate what He wants. What matters more than our message is the soil.   \nThis is the principle Jesus illustrates in Mark 4 with the parable of the sower. We don’t know much about the seed, or the talent of the sower. We simply know that he scattered it generously, and the soil determined the rest. For us, this means two things:\nFirst, this parable challenges our notion of talent and its importance for the purposes of God. It’s easy to assume that the most talented writers, teachers, preachers, or social media influencers set the bar for ministry effectiveness. But that is not at all what Jesus is saying here. Instead, Jesus implies how little control we exercise over what a person hears. We can articulate the gospel as clearly and brilliantly as possible, but if the soil is bad, the seed will not take root. Likewise, we can communicate a teeny tiny, mustard seed of truth, but what people hear is different—and sometimes much more powerful!—than what we intended to say. This frees us from the insecurities and self-doubt that often inhibit obedience.\nThe second takeaway from Mark 4 shifts away from our role as the sower to our role as the soil. Many of us are only willing to receive God’s truth from certain sowers. We cannot learn (or will not learn) from preachers whose styles we do not prefer or whose theology is not quite in sync with our own. While we should certainly be discerning about false teaching, Jesus challenges us to search ourselves and the state of our heart’s soil because the Word of God is always good seed. If it bounces straight off of our ears, then perhaps we need to examine our soil before blaming the sower.  \nJesus exemplified both of these principles by teaching in the form of parables, which were deliberately opaque. If ever the soil could blame the sower for scattering the seed badly, parables would be it! But Jesus was driving home the truth that our preaching has less power than our faithfulness. “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen” (Mark 4:9): Be obedient, and trust the Holy Spirit with the rest. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey Gillespie\nIt was mid-afternoon when I sat on the crinkly white parchment paper, swinging my legs like a five-year-old. I’d taken half a day off work to make the appointment. For four years, my stomach hurt every single day, and no amount of dietary changes, supplements, or prescriptions could alleviate it. I was desperate to be healed. So, I sat in the cold doctor’s room and waited for a new diagnosis.\nIn Mark 5, we find two very different scenes where Jesus interrupts the lives or people who also needed to be healed. \nAfter Jesus casts out demons from a man they possessed, He tells him, “Report to them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you” (Mark 5:19). This exorcism was worth broadcasting all over town because Jesus didn’t just heal the man by wiping out all memory of his demonic bondage. He gave him a story of mercy—one that amazed everyone who heard it (v.20).\nNext, we meet a woman who had a bleeding disorder for twelve years (v.25). In a tender moment that makes me want to cry, we’re told that this woman touched Jesus’s clothing and then “sensed in her body that she was healed” (vv.27, 29). Can you imagine the reaction she must have had after carrying around this messy, unwanted affliction for so long, as well as the frustration of countless medical dead ends (v.26)?\nJust like the demon-possessed man, her healing was not meant for her alone. It was another story of mercy to be passed down, so that people like you and me, and those who come after us, can learn about the character of our Savior. \nJesus is absolutely concerned with our physical healing, but He cares most about our spiritual healing. He cares about our wholeness. As believers, we have received the staggering gift of spiritual reconciliation—which means when we accept God’s love, He extends His mercy through Christ and restores our hearts to Him without the barrier of sin. \nAlthough I haven’t yet been healed from my physical ailments, without a doubt Jesus has rescued, restored, and healed my heart. Time and again, He has consoled me with the comfort of His presence in my darkest nights. He has rescued me from myself through the kindness and intercession of others. And, quite honestly, even in the moments when I’m too hurt to receive His comfort or perceive His presence, I have these stories in Mark as a witness of His rescue. They help me believe. \nThe Lord has done amazing things for us, both seen and unseen. His mercy changes the trajectory of our lives. Even demons shudder at the power of Jesus (James 2:19), and this same power is what dwells inside us through the Holy Spirit. Let’s keep talking about the things God has done for us that amaze us. Let’s help each other believe. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Amanda Bible Williams\nWhen Jesus invited His disciples to steal away, sit, and rest for a while, you can imagine how readily they took Him up on the offer. Some passages in Mark’s Gospel make it sound nothing short of chaotic. With so many people coming and going, the disciples didn’t even have time to eat (Mark 6:31). But they’d seen the Son of God in all His glory, healing and saving and bringing dead people back to life. He was who the prophets said He was. They believed! Most of the time.\nSound familiar? The chaos swirls and the demands of the day rise like waves, ready to wipe out all our best intentions. But Jesus says, “Come away. Find the quiet. Rest a while.” The disciples tried, but chaos followed. When Jesus and the Twelve got into boats and sailed off “to a remote place” (v.32), word spread, and there was a crowd waiting for them when they reached the shore.\nJesus, being the compassionate Son of God, got out of the boat and taught the people well into the night, right there at the edge of the shore. The disciples, naturally, got antsy. “Send them away,” they said. “They must be hungry for dinner.” His response? A gentle nudge forward to faith: You’re right. You feed them (vv.34–37). But feed them what? All they had on hand was some fish, a few loaves…and Him (v.8). It’s Me, you guys. Believe.\nAfter that miraculous feast, Jesus sent the disciples ahead again by boat, but chaos still followed—this time in the form of wind and waves. Jesus walked to them, holy feet on top of the water, and they cried out in fear at the sight. But He told them: “Have courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid” (Mark 6:50). It’s Me, you guys. Believe.\nThis would be the pattern. Wherever Jesus and His disciples went, people rushed through the streets to find Him, hoping just to brush against the robe of the one who could make them well. “And everyone who touched it was healed” (v.56). And the Twelve saw it all. They were standing right there. Still, they struggled to believe. Still, Jesus had to constantly remind them that He was who He said He was. It’s Me, you guys. Believe.\nWe’ve seen Him too—up close in our lives and in His Word—changing hearts, healing sickness, and bringing hope to the dark. And still, here in the chaos, we struggle to believe. \nBut the Son of God stands and calls to us, just as He called to the Twelve. He calls us to come away and rest for awhile, to remember He is who He says He is. Yes, we are weak and weary, but we are invited to stay near the very Son of God. We can rest in the knowledge that He still has the power to feed and calm and heal.\nIt really is Him, friends. We can believe.  ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Abby Flynn\nA young girl with an unclean spirit. A deaf man who could hardly speak. A Gentile woman begging for her demon-possessed daughter to be healed, believing that even the smallest amount of Jesus’s power could change everything. (She was right.) These were just some of the lives changed forever by the hand of Jesus in Mark 7. \nLater, a deaf man came, longing for healing. So Jesus took the man away from the crowd in private. “After putting his fingers in the man’s ears and spitting, he touched his tongue. Looking up to heaven, he sighed deeply and said to him…‘Be opened!’” At these simple words, the man’s hearing and speech were restored (v.33–36). Incredible, right? I think the onlookers at the end of this chapter summarized it best: “They were extremely astonished and said, ‘He has done everything well’” (Mark 7:37).\nI sometimes wish I could’ve been there to see all these incredible miracles with my own eyes. Because I would’ve immediately believed that Jesus is the Son of God—right? In Mark, we see that Jesus and His disciples were judged harshly by the religious elite; they didn’t stick to the religious rules and traditions of the day, and the Pharisees were angry about it. But Jesus proved there is a difference between the traditions of man and the heart of God. \nIf we’re not careful, it can be easy to fall into a legalistic mindset as followers of Jesus. If Jesus does all things well and I want to be more like Him, that means I need to do everything well too. That’s often the logic we cling to. But becoming more like Christ isn’t about following rules—it’s about following Him. \nTrue faith isn’t only about what we say we believe; it’s about our hearts and how we live (v.6). God Himself is greater than our traditions and the way we’ve done things in the past (v.9). And we can’t fool God. Everything that comes out of us is a result of what is in our heart (v.15). What we let grow inside of us is what will come out. From the esteemed religious leaders came judgment, gossip, scheming, and hatred. From Jesus came wisdom, healing, and power. To become more like the God who does all things well, we need to spend a lot less time trying to impress each other and a whole lot more time abiding in Him. \nSo what is growing inside of you? Is it selfishness? Jealousy of other people? Slander about your boss? Or are you digging deep into the Word of God and continually asking Him for help? Pray today that you would seek to grow closer to the one who does all things well. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nIn today’s society, we are familiar with the term “followers.” From big-time celebrities to your neighbor next door, we all have a group of people who “follow” us because they want a look into our lives—they want to know who we are and what we are about. We sometimes follow others because we want to emulate their marriage, parenting style, home décor, or eating habits. We think we are getting a clear picture on who this person actually is just by following pieces of their story. When Jesus invited His disciples to follow Him, He was asking them to watch what He did and learn from Him. Little did they know what Jesus was actually inviting them into. He wasn’t just asking them to take bits and pieces of His teachings; He wanted them to learn to emulate His whole life. \nHis followers watched as He took a few loaves of bread and fish and fed four thousand people. Not four, not forty, not four hundred, but four thousand people! Yet, the disciples still did not quite understand who they were following (Mark 8:21). They observed closely as He healed a blind man with the spit from His mouth and the palm of His hands. A miracle! Yet, some still didn’t really understand who they were following. So Jesus asked them, “But you…who do you say that I am?” (v.29).\nIf we choose to follow Him, it’s important to ask ourselves, “Who is Jesus?” Because, unlike a celebrity we can choose to follow or unfollow with little to no consequence, following Jesus costs us our lives. Jesus said, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life because of me and the gospel will save it” (Mark 8:34–35). \nSo, who is Jesus? \nPeter wisely replies, “You are the Messiah” (Mark 8:29). The Greek word used for Messiah here is Christos, which means “anointed one.” Peter recognized that Jesus was more than a magician or healer; He is the Son of God. He is the anointed King described in Daniel 7:13–14, the one who has been given dominion and glory and a kingdom that will never be destroyed. \nThe disciples were following the King of kings, and we have the opportunity to follow Him too. But we must discern the truth: Do our perceptions of Jesus flow from who He actually is? Or have we designed our own “personalized” Jesus, one whose teachings we can take or leave, depending on how we feel about them? As we learn to follow Jesus wholeheartedly, He continues to teach us more about Himself than we could imagine. Feeding four thousand people, healing the blind—these were just the start. ",

		"devo_title": "Jesus Is Transfigured",
		"devo_summary": "BY Abby Flynn\nGrowing up, Jesus wasn’t anyone special in the eyes of most people. Nothing about His appearance drew attention (Isaiah 53:2). He lived a normal life in a normal place. He didn’t come in glory and splendor. Instead, He came clothed in humble humanity. But in today’s reading, in this moment of His transfiguration, everything changed. No longer was He just the normal-looking guy from Nazareth. Now, He shone in glory, both fully man and fully God. \nThe transfiguration in Mark 9 is a pretty unbelievable story. I mean, can you imagine standing there with Peter, James, and John, then suddenly seeing Jesus change right before your eyes? But here, on top of a mountain, Jesus became the physical representation of God’s glory—the same glory that radiated from Moses after spending time with God on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:29–35).\nThey went up the mountain with the Jesus they thought they knew. Now they found themselves in front of the transfigured Son of the living God. Mark tells us Jesus’s clothes were “dazzling—extremely white as no launderer on earth could whiten them” (Mark 9:3). Can you imagine? And then Elijah and Moses himself appeared beside Jesus, talking to Him. That must’ve been a terrifying sight for these disciples! Not knowing what to do or how to respond, Peter decided it might be a good idea to set up shelters for them (v.6). But then God stepped in: \n“A cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud: ‘This is my beloved Son; listen to him!’” (v.7). \nIn that incredible moment, God confirmed that Jesus is His Son, like He had announced at Jesus’s baptism (Mark 1:9–11). He was the Savior they had been waiting for! Then Moses and Elijah were gone, and the disciples were once again alone with Jesus. \nAll too often, I respond like Peter did on that mountain. When I don’t understand what God is up to, I try to reason or take action to make life make sense. I know the power of God and what He can do, but it’s just so easy to doubt when I’m not the one in control. Rather than enjoying God’s presence and waiting for Him to reveal what’s next, I seek distraction.\nHow often do you act out of fear or confusion, instead of stopping to look for the presence of the living God around you? Take time to stop and notice God’s presence, how His power is at work. The hardest work has already been done. Sometimes our only task is to watch for Him, wait for Him, and enjoy Him. Peter, James, and John witnessed Jesus’s transfiguration and were no doubt changed. In His presence, we are changed too. May we open our eyes to truly see Him at work all around us.",

You should have applied when he was first born to get him on the waitlist. Now you’ll never be able to get into the school you want.” My son was only two at the time! How was I to know getting into preschool would be almost impossible?\nThere were so many ways I wanted to solve the problem. Should we see if we have any connection to the school? Should we just tell them we’re really nice people, so they will accept our son? What would it take to get us in?\nSimilar questions were raised in Mark 10, when the disciples were concerned about getting into heaven. In this chapter, a rich young ruler asked how to inherit eternal life (vv.17–22). He seemed to be doing all the right things, but he could not give up his affection for wealth in order to follow Jesus. And then Jesus said that it’s easier for “a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God” (v.25). At this, the disciples grew worried. How would they ever be able to enter heaven? What more could they do to get into the kingdom of God?\nWhether we’re aware of it or not, we often try to prove ourselves worthy of our spot in the kingdom. We want to be seen giving to charity, praying the best prayers, and reading our Bibles daily so our salvation seems credible. If our salvation rested on us alone, though, we would also need to reconcile our sin, much like the rich young ruler. What comforts do we still cling to? What idols are we still resistant to rid ourselves of? Do we really want God more than anything or anyone else? \nThankfully, our ability to follow Jesus does not rest on our strength. Like James and John, who wondered how they could get a seat of honor in heaven, we may think we can earn our way into God’s kingdom. The truth is, redemption is an act only God Himself can accomplish. “With man it is impossible, but not with God, because all things are possible with God” (Mark 10:27). \nGod opened the gates to His kingdom through Jesus’s death and resurrection. There are no waitlists in God’s kingdom. There are no impossible standards of holiness to attain—only the perfect righteousness Jesus already achieved and extends to us.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Raechel Myers\nThe day our son was born, I was astonished.\nThe mere reality of birth was a surprise. One minute, there were four people in the room, and the next, there were five. He looked nothing like I’d expected, and his birth didn’t go anything like I’d planned. I was shocked by how immediately I felt the pride and protective instincts of a mother. The whole experience was unexpected, yet wonderful—astonishing.\nFast forward six years. I was at the grocery store when I heard the news that Sandy Hook Elementary had been attacked by a gunman. Children my own child’s age were terrorized, injured, even killed. When my son came home from school that afternoon he was fine—but I was not. I was not astonished that day; I was afraid, weeping into the night, praying for protection for my own son and comfort for those in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, whose lives would never be the same. \nAstonished and afraid. There’s a big difference, isn’t there? When I read Mark 11, I notice both of these reactions to Jesus upon His arrival in Jerusalem. Just after Jesus overturned the tables and chairs in the temple, the chief priests began “looking for a way to kill him. For they were afraid of him” (Mark 11:18). But the crowd? In that very same moment, they were “astonished by his teaching.” Later, the chief priests weren’t able to give an answer to Jesus’s question about John’s baptism. Why? Because “they were afraid of the crowd” (v.32).\nThis dichotomy appears often in Jesus’s ministry: the crowds were astonished and the religious leaders were almost always afraid. In Mark 1, when Jesus cleansed a man of an unclean spirit, the crowd was “astonished at his teaching because he was teaching them as one who had authority” (v.22). As we read about Jesus’s authority and those who hoped to explain it away, I wonder, How do I react when I encounter Jesus’s authority in my own life? \nAm I afraid? Does it compel me to hold tight to the things I love, afraid He’ll shake up my plans? Do I feel astonished at His power, like I was when meeting my son? Am I surprised and delighted by the way Jesus works in ways I don’t expect?\nAs we read Mark 11 today, let’s notice the authority with which Jesus rides into Jerusalem like the King that He is, and how He surveyed the temple quietly, then commanded the fig tree to wither. Let’s watch the unexpected, yet wonderful way Jesus cleanses His Father’s house and answers the chief priests as they attempt to usurp Him. \nBecause Jesus is God’s Son and our King, His authority doesn’t have to make us afraid. We can simply watch, astonished by the King of kings, who has all authority in heaven and on earth. We can praise Him, saying, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!” (Mark 11:9).",

		"devo_summary": "BY Kara Gause\nI didn’t grow up going to church, not at first. But somewhere along the way, my mother taught me the Lord’s Prayer (yes, the King James Version). I didn’t know it was spoken by Jesus, or that it was His instruction—an outline of sorts—for how to talk to God (Matthew 6:9–13). Still, it became a touchstone for me when I was afraid, an anchor when I was overwhelmed, and a hope for lasting connection to the God I had yet to meet. \nThe Jewish faith has a version of this. It’s a prayer from Deuteronomy 6 that for many is spoken daily, morning and evening, and in temple services. It’s called the Shema, and it’s quoted by Jesus in today’s reading from Mark 12. When the scribes and Sadducees came to probe Jesus about His understanding of Scripture, He was, naturally, able to answer their questions. One scribe in particular asked Him, “Which command is the most important of all?” (Mark 12:28). Jesus responded:\n“The most important is Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.The second is, Love your neighbor as yourself.There is no other command greater than these” (vv.29–31).\nThe scribe agreed, as Jesus was referencing the central command of the Jewish faith, given to the Israelites after the Ten Commandments (Deuteronomy 6:4–5). This command begins with the Hebrew word shema, which means “to hear” or “listen” and also implies action—a life lived wholly loyal to God. It’s as if Moses was saying, “Pay attention! This is important!” The Shema is a reminder of who God is: the one true God, who loves us. Because He loves us, we’re to love Him back with everything we’ve got: our whole being, affection, intention, and will—our heart, soul, mind, and strength.\nThe Shema is the foundational principle for every other commandment that comes before and after it. Perhaps, in giving His people a Law they could not keep (Joshua 22:5; 24:21–24; Matthew 5:17), God wanted to remind His people of the one thing truly necessary for covenant relationship with Him. Jesus praises the scribe for understanding what is at the heart of the entire Law. \nGod gave everything of Himself to restore relationship with us—from humbling Himself to be born as a baby to dying a painful death on the cross. He’s devoted and wants our devotion. He wants us to actively love Him, and then display that love by loving our fellow image-bearers as He does (Genesis 1:27; Mark 12:31). No, we won’t always get it right, but He knew that too! So, He sent His Spirit to make us more like Jesus, to love like Him and shape our lives around Him. Jesus is the touchstone and the cornerstone (Mark 12:10–11). Everything begins and ends—then begins again—with this God who loved us first (1 John 4:19).",

		"devo_summary": "BY Abby Flynn\nThe first time I heard about the tribulation and rapture, my young mind went wild. From then on, whenever I couldn’t find my parents in a grocery store, it hit just a little differently. When I woke up and the house was quiet, I would wonder, Is this the end of the world? Did the rapture happen? Have I been left behind? \nAs I got older, I spent more time studying Scripture, looking for clues on when the earth as we know it would come to an end. What I found was this: no one has concrete answers on the day and time it will all go down—“neither the angels of heaven nor the Son—[no one] except the Father” (Matthew 24:36). And that’s more than okay. Still, there’s something in our human nature that leaves us longing to know everything. We want answers, and we want them now. But God doesn’t ask us to know everything. He asks us to trust Him. \nIn Mark 13, Jesus’s disciples asked Him about the end of the age. They knew everything was going to change, but they wanted specifics. They wanted to know the details, what signs to look for so they could prepare themselves (v.4).\nJesus talks about the end of the age and warns them that in the days ahead, there will be false prophets, wars, famine, and turmoil (Mark 13:5–6). The disciples would go on to face persecution like never before, but their calling would remain the same: to preach the gospel to all nations (v.10). And instead of the end of time, these signs would represent the start of something new. When Jesus left, the Holy Spirit would come in His place, and His followers would never be alone or without Him again (v.11). \nI imagine that was a lot for the disciples to hear, let alone understand—that even when everything seems like a mystery and feels confusing, in reality, God remains on His throne. He remains in control. And when He comes again, we will see that He still holds all glory and power (vv.26–27). Knowing this, Jesus makes a promise to His disciples:\n“Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Mark 13:31).\nOnly God knows what is to come. Some things are just not for us to know. As followers of Jesus, our job is to trust, watch, and stay alert. In the meantime, how we live and wait for Him matters (vv.32–37). One day, the earth will wear out like a garment; nothing in it will last (Isaiah 51:6). Nice cars, expensive shoes, dream jobs, money, and power—it’s all passing away. But God’s salvation and righteousness will last forever. That is what we cling to. That is the only thing we need to know. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nJesus’s life evoked varied, and often strong, responses. In today’s reading from Mark, we find two such responses. There’s the woman who poured out all she had, giving Him her best, and there’s Judas, seeking momentary gain. \nIn Mark 14, Jesus was reclining at a dinner party when a woman burst into the room, broke an expensive jar of perfume, and poured it out on Jesus’s head. Talk about a public display of affection! She had no shame about using her most valuable possession to worship Jesus and give Him glory. The party guests chastised her actions as wasteful, but Jesus proclaimed, “Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her” (Mark 14:9). Jesus told the guests that the price of the woman’s perfume paled in comparison to His coming sacrifice. She prepared Jesus’s body like a King, an honor worthy of the one who promised eternal life (Mark 10:29–31). \nIn contrast, we see Judas and the Pharisees also preparing for the death of Jesus. But they did not seek to honor Him like a King—instead, they plotted to have Him put to death as a criminal. Judas was offered money to betray Jesus, and he took it (Mark 14:10–12). Instead of pouring out everything of earthly value in exchange for “a hundred times more…and eternal life in the age to come,” he schemed in the shadows and waited to hand Jesus over for some silver coins. He put his trust in a tangible, physical thing he could hold that day instead of what is eternal (Mark 10:29–31).\nAs I read this passage, I find myself wrestling with dueling desires: wanting to honor Jesus and trust in the future He has promised, and wanting to run away and put my trust in what I think will meet my needs today. \nJesus knows the heart of every person. He knew the heart of Judas, the heart of the woman who honored Him with perfume, and He knows our own wayward hearts—and He still died for us. Even when our hearts are turned away from Him, Jesus pursues us and had already prepared a way for us to turn back to Him. \nWhen we are tempted like Judas to run after other things, I pray we will remember what Jesus has done for us and what He promises for our future. May His compassion and saving grace lead us to be as bold and faithful as the woman at that dinner the weekend Jesus died, honoring His gift of salvation with the fragrant offering of a surrendered life for His glory (Ephesians 5:1–2). ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Sharon Hodde Miller\nOne day while I was shopping, I walked past the stationery section and noticed a journal with this quote on its cover: “I am fearless, and therefore powerful.” The journal did not cite the source, but the quote originates from Mary Shelley’s classic novel, Frankenstein. And although the cover was cute and feminine in design, these words were spoken by Frankenstein’s monster.\nFor some reason I stopped and stared at the journal for quite some time. It was the kind of inspiring statement that has become ubiquitous in our culture today. But like many of our most popular affirmations, it is not actually true. The truth is, no one’s power comes from being fearless, because no one is truly fearless. To be human is to experience fear at some time or another, which is why these words could only be spoken by a non-human monster!\nNo, the presence of fear does not make us less powerful. It is what we do when we are afraid or distressed that either empowers or undermines us. There is no more poignant example of this principle than Jesus Himself. In verse 34, Jesus confesses to being “deeply grieved to the point of death,” begging God to remove the cup of His suffering, for it to pass from Him (v.36). And in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is described as being so anguished that He sweats drops of blood (Luke 22:44). \nJesus takes up His cross, but this strength does not come from the absence of grief; it comes from intimacy with the Father. Jesus chooses to spend His final hours on earth by praying to His Father, and it is this—not fearlessness—that prepares Him for death (Hebrews 5:7–8). \nIn a culture of self-help mantras that are, very often, dishonest, it is important that we hold them up to the reality of God’s Word and the humanity of Christ. Fearlessness sounds like a noble goal, but it is an impossible standard to achieve, and therefore, an empty source of personal power. In Christ, we find a better gospel: we are free to be real human beings, and we are reminded of where true power lies.\nIf I had the chance to rewrite that journal cover, I would probably replace it with a different set of borrowed words:\n“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is perfected in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).\nOur power does not come from ourselves, and this is good news. Whatever you are facing, take it to the only real source of power. Take it to God in prayer. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Abby Flynn\nAfter being betrayed by one of His disciples, Jesus was arrested and put on trial. His crime? Claiming to be the Son of God. He was tried first by the high priest, who wanted Jesus to defend Himself against His accusers. But Jesus stayed silent.\nMeanwhile, Peter hovered around, waiting to see what would happen. Afraid for his own life, and not wanting to be connected to Jesus, Peter repeatedly denied knowing Him. \nWhen Jesus was tried before Pilate, He was again pressed to defend Himself, but to no effect. Then there were the soldiers who mocked and humiliated Jesus. Can’t you just picture them, egging each other on and casting lots for His clothing? And even still, Jesus refused to go on the defense (vv.16–20).\nAt the end of His life, in excruciating pain, Jesus cried out to His Father (Mark 15:37).  A centurion saw the way Jesus died, and said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” (v.39). For those who still doubted, perhaps the darkened sky and torn curtain within the temple forced them to look again (vv.33, 37). \nJesus was a real man who walked this earth. His rejection was real. He felt the pain of separation from God the Father. He took on our shame and punishment so we don’t have to carry it anymore. And He did this with meekness and humility, surrendering His earthly reputation for His eternal purpose (Hebrews 12:2).\nIn revisiting Jesus’s death, we can learn a lot about how we ought to live. I’m reminded that becoming more like Jesus isn’t about being impressive, attractive, popular, or rich. We don’t have to be loud, boastful, or universally liked. Our Savior sure wasn’t. Scripture says it was envy that made the chief priests hate Jesus; they were jealous of His power and influence (v.10). Pilate listened to them because he longed to please the crowd and protect his own image and position before Rome. \nSo often we’re like those priests, the soldiers, Peter, and Pilate; we seek to protect our image and reputation at the expense of boldly knowing Jesus. Living this way is in direct opposition to the message and power of the cross.\nJesus, help us let go of worrying about how we’re perceived by others. Give us a hunger to know You and the power of Your resurrection. Help us reject what this world deems important and teach us to follow humbly after Your example instead. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nStanding off in the distance, the same women who had watched Joseph of Arimathea take Jesus’s body down from the cross also watched as His body was “laid in a tomb cut out of the rock,” with a stone rolled against the entrance (Mark 15:46). Their Savior, Lord, and friend was now dead and buried. \nCan you imagine how they felt? If I had been there to witness the stone being rolled over the entrance—sealing His body inside—I wonder if my waning hope for a Savior King would’ve been sealed inside, too. The darkness and overwhelming sadness of the event must have made Jesus’s trusted followers feel utterly hopeless. \nMany of us know what it feels like to believe God has left us. We know what it’s like to doubt. We’ve had our own dark seasons—seasons where we’ve felt susceptible to the attacks of the evil one, lacking all peace. \nI have walked through seasons of depression and extreme anxiety and have had the same thoughts as the writer of Lamentations: “My future is lost, as well as my hope from the LORD” (3:18). And in those moments, there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel or an end to the suffering. \nFor followers of Jesus in that day, it was difficult to see the light at the end of their tunnel. We can now rest on this side of the resurrection, but it’s important to sit in the space where those first Christ followers once found themselves. Sometimes, we need to lean into our questions, doubts, and brokenness with open hands, expectantly waiting for God’s next move. Because even when it seems all is lost, dead and buried and grieved, God is still doing something.\nWhile the disciples hid in their homes, God was busy defeating sin and death. While Mary Magdalene looked at the closed tomb, God was reconciling everything to Himself through Jesus’s blood, shed on the cross (Colossians 1:20). While Jesus’s followers sat with doubt, fear, sadness, and loss, God was faithful to keep His promise to save His people. \nIn our dark seasons, when we feel hopeless, God is still moving and working things out for our good. There is hope in Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. “Death no longer rules over him. For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus” (Romans 6:9–11). Jesus is still our one, good hope. May we stay expectant of God’s deliverance.",

They had watched as He was laid in the tomb, and now they were coming back to tend His body. This was their reality now.\nIt was resurrection morning, but they didn’t know it yet. They arrived at the tomb, prepared to see their crucified Lord for the last time. Instead, an angel appeared, giving them the best news. “You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen!” (Mark 16:6). The time for mourning had ended, and it was now morning, in every sense of the word. \nHe has risen. All of our faith hinges on this truth (1 Corinthians 15:17). Because of Jesus’s death and resurrection, God has forgiven our sins and welcomed us into His great family. He invites us to encounter Him daily, as His Spirit dwells in us and produces fruit in us. Today, we rejoice over all we gain because of Jesus’s resurrection. \nHe has risen. The gospel isn’t just good news for today. The reality of Jesus’s resurrection also gives us hope for all of our tomorrows. As we navigate life on this side of His resurrection, we live in anticipation of His return. This means that no matter what circumstance life presents us with, we can take comfort in the fact that our Savior is with us, always. We can take heart, because there’s more to this life than…well, this life (1 Corinthians 15:29). Even though we experience hardness and deep grief along with the everyday sighs of life, we have a rich and vibrant hope.\nHe has risen. His resurrection guarantees our own. Not even death can change that! The risen Savior will return for us, His beloved people. God fulfilled His promise to send a Savior to redeem us, and we can rest assured our risen Savior will return for us. On that day, there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain (Revelation 21:4). He will wipe away every tear from our eyes. He will dwell with us, His people, completely and forever. It is good news, indeed! ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Amanda Bible Williams\nToday’s Reading: You’ll notice the Scripture reading for today is longer than the others. These chapters from the book of Acts provide context for our study of 1 & 2 Thessalonians.\nMy grandmother had five siblings, and by the time I came along, the six had married to become twelve. I grew up around their vegetable and flower gardens, in their kitchens that smelled of soup beans and cornbread. I listened to them tell stories late into the night, sat by as they played cards amid uproarious laughter, even stood outside in my pajamas after dark as they howled old songs by the light of the moon. \nI rarely think of one of them without thinking of all of them. In my mind they were a set—always connected. That’s not to say they were always together over the years. They saw wars and endured moves and raised children in different states across the country. But when life separated them, they built bridges with letters. They wrote letters home from overseas, sent postcards when they traveled, mailed handwritten pages of updates from one address to the other.  Even now that only two of the twelve remain, they write letters to us, their family. They keep us connected still. \nLetters encourage in a way email never will. They speak to a part of the soul that social media comments can’t quite reach. When I read the letters from the apostle Paul to the church at Thessalonica, I hear the earnestness of words written by hand and carried on foot. I hear a weary pastor, a brother in the faith, longing to see his congregation—his family. \nToday’s Scripture reading gives us context for our study of the letters of 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Acts 16 and 17 tell how Paul visited Thessalonica on his second missionary journey—a journey that included many other cities and countless trials along the way. The apostle faithfully preached the gospel to anyone in earshot, and they ran him out of nearly every town he dared enter. But Paul’s work was not in vain, because the Holy Spirit was at work. Families of faith formed along his route, one of them in Thessalonica. \nPaul’s letters to the Thessalonian believers are like so many of his other letters, filled with instruction on how to live the Christian life. But these letters do more than clarify theology; they are filled to the brim with affection and encouragement for the men and women whose belief in and hunger for the gospel encouraged him, their teacher. Paul wrote to build up his Thessalonian faith family, not with empty platitudes, but with a hope rooted in one truth: “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah” (Acts 17:3). ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Rebecca Faires\nTheologian G. K. Chesterton believed “that thanks are the highest form of thought, and that gratitude is happiness doubled by wonder.” Paul is setting an example for his beloved Thessalonians by weaving his own thankfulness throughout this letter to them. And he doesn’t just thank them for doing a great job; he thanks God for all the saving benefits bestowed on them, and celebrates the evidence of the gospel in their lives (1Thessalonians 1:2–5). \nPaul is thankful for how they have become imitators of the Lord, bearing His image to the Macedonians. He is thankful for how “the word of the Lord rang out from [them]” through faith and in everything He has called them to do (vv.6–8). They have done all of this with joy, strengthened by the Holy Spirit, and despite ongoing persecution. Paul is thankful for these things because he knows that if they remain rooted in the love of Christ, they will be “more than conquerors” (Romans 8:37) over the affliction and distress and persecution they will surely encounter because of their devotion to Him (v.35).\nBut above all, Paul’s thanks are to God. \nAll good comes from God, so apart from Him, no good can be hoped for by sinners. Paul’s thanks to God are appropriate because God is the author of all that is good—not just all the good that comes to us, but even all the good that is done by us, whether in good or dire circumstances. \nDo you find yourself in a habit of gratefulness to God? When I consider the words that come out of my mouth, I’m definitely teasing or complaining at least as much as I’m blessing and thanking.\nIf you also find yourself struck by the mockery and ungratefulness that escapes your lips and hangs around your mind, you’re in good company. But don’t just grit your teeth and try harder. Paul immediately points us to the three cardinal graces: faith, hope, and love. And he doesn’t say, “Try harder, y’all! Get you some more faith, hope, and love!” Instead, he names the cause of these graces: our Lord, Jesus Christ.\nAll good comes from Christ, and any change in our hearts comes from Him. He is the object and also the instigator of our thankfulness. For the gospel comes to us not only in words, but also in power (1Thessalonians 1:5)—His power.",

		"devo_title": "Walking Worthy of God",
		"devo_summary": "BY Melanie Rainer\nI’ve been a wannabe long-distance runner for the last decade or so—“wannabe” being the key word there. A few years ago, I decided to run a marathon: 26.2 miles. I loved it so much, but my knees did not. This conundrum led me to a physical therapist who watched me jog back and forth a few times in her office. She looked at me and said, “Your knees don’t point the right way.” \nI looked down, and she was right! My kneecaps don’t point straight ahead. In fact, they point pretty far inward. If a laser beam were to be shot out from each of my knees, the beams would cross almost immediately, which is not ideal for long-distance running. When my gait was off, it threatened the integrity of my entire stride. It placed more strain on certain muscles, causing them to stretch in ways they were never intended to stretch. So, I bought new shoes with better orthotics, and I began the slow retraining process of running with my knees facing out.\nWhen Paul talks in 1 Thessalonians 2 about “walk worthy of God,” he is diagnosing the church in Thessalonica. If the mechanics of their walk were off, their witness would be too. And so, like a good coach, he jumped in to show them the right way to walk. He tells them, “Like a father with his own children, we encouraged, comforted, and implored each of you to walk worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory” (vv.11–12). \nPaul gives the Thessalonians a template for walking worthy of God by reminding them of how he lived among them. He spoke “the gospel of God to them in spite of great opposition,” without “greedy,” self-seeking motives or “flattering,” empty words (vv.2,5). Paul did not seek his own glory, but walked with gentleness, looking after them like a nursing mother “nurtures her own children” (v.7). \nPaul shared his whole life with the Thessalonians—not glimpses of his piety made to make him the hero. While with the Thessalonians, he conducted himself “devoutly, righteously, and blamelessly” (v.10). These words, in particular, strike me: “We cared so much for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us” (v.8).\nPaul describes the joy of his missionary journey to Thessalonica not only in sharing the gospel, but in sharing life with his dear friends. He talks as much about his actions, demeanor, and motivations as he does his words. And perhaps that’s the goal to walk away with. Not walking “perfectly,” but walking together. Walking in the same direction, toward Jesus, with gentleness, humility, and community. We cannot walk worthy if we are always alone, but we can walk alongside those who lovingly correct our steps, reminding us of the finish line, and sharing in our burdens—not for their own glory, but for Christ’s.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nOur heart’s readiness to welcome God’s word can be examined much like a farmer examines the ground for planting. There is healthy, usable soil (a ready heart), and there is hard, difficult soil (a heart not yet prepared) that takes a lot of effort and back-breaking work to make usable again. In the book of Jeremiah, the Lord warns Israel about allowing the soil of their hearts to become hard and thorny. He tells them to “break up the unplowed ground” and “not sow among the thorns” (Jeremiah 4:3).\nGod’s people were planting seeds without having prepared the soil of their souls, and so the seeds of faith had no ground to mature. How do we avoid planting seeds of faith on rocky, shallow ground? How do we practice breaking up the hard places of our hearts to welcome God’s word into our hearts?\nI’ve never personally planted anything—caked my hands with dirt, gently cradled roots, or sought the best soil for a plant to grow well. I can barely keep indoor plants already potted in good soil alive. So, I can only imagine the difficult work of removing large rocks, gathering thorns and weeds to be thrown out and turning the ground into something usable. \nThankfully, when it comes to matters of our hearts, Jesus came to break up the unplowed ground through His life, death, and resurrection. When Jesus was on earth, He brought the good news to the Jewish people—His people—though they had not done a good job of keeping their hearts prepared to receive Him. Welcoming the word of God is more than receiving a Bible passage or following God’s law; it is receiving the person of Jesus (John 1:1). Some people were threatened by His popularity and power, so they constantly looked for ways to silence Him; the soil of their hearts rejected Jesus.\nYet, there was another group of people who received the word of God and welcomed it (1Thessalonians 2:13). These people had hearts with good soil, and when they heard about Jesus, the seeds of faith took root. And to all who received in Him, “he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name” (John 1:12). \nAs children of God, we must tend to the soil of our hearts more than once. When growing food or flowers, it’s necessary to prepare the ground seasonally. We can’t simply plant a seed and walk away, hoping to grow good food the next year without any effort. We must regularly practice the spiritual discipline of welcoming Jesus into our hearts. We need to tend to the soil of our hearts, so that it does not become overrun by weeds and thorns. We need to water our faith often with the word of God, replanting some unmet desires through prayer. \nTake time to examine your soil.

		"devo_summary": "BY Abby Flynn\nMy favorite place to be is definitely basking in the sun on a beach somewhere. My second favorite place? Cozied up in a huge sweater, under a big blanket, in front of a fireplace with a fresh cup of coffee. While I do sometimes get moments like these, the reality is that most days life isn’t full of warm fuzzy moments.\nSometimes I worry that, in these modern times, we’ve reduced Christianity down to feelings of warm fuzzies. When we’re encouraging our brothers and sisters in Christ, or sharing our faith with an unbeliever, of course, we want to highlight all the good stuff. Yes, God is with you. Yes, He loves you unconditionally. Yes, He has a plan for your life. All of these things are great, true, biblical, and important. But there’s more to the story.\nIn reading Paul’s message to the Thessalonian church, we realize just how young they are in their faith. They are still learning, yet they’re already facing persecution because of their newfound faith. So, while Paul can’t be with them in person, he wants to encourage them in their faith and how far they’ve come. He tells them, “Indeed you are our glory and joy!” (1Thessalonians 2:20). He wants them to know that even in their separation, there is hope because the Lord is still working.\nIn his absence, Paul sent Timothy to encourage them. What they were facing was nothing new for the church at large. In those times, persecution and Christianity went hand in hand because their faith stood so far removed from the culture they lived in.\nIn his letter, Paul tells the Thessalonians to not be shaken by this persecution because they have been appointed for this very thing, that affliction will come (1Thessalonians 3:3–4). Paul also warns that if they aren’t careful, Satan will try to tempt them from their place of affliction and pain (v.5). Still, these temptations do not mean that God’s love for them has somehow lessened; it is actually proof that they are living out His purpose for their lives.\nThis letter is also a reminder for us that walking with God doesn’t mean we’re exempt from hurt or pain. Choosing faith in Christ doesn’t keep us from struggle or temptation by the evil one. Here’s what it does mean: We know the end of the story!\nIn our world, there will be conflict. There will be strife. We will struggle. It’s guaranteed (John 16:33). Jesus suffered unimaginably for us; to love and follow Him is to know suffering too. But in the midst of difficulty and struggle, whose voice will you listen to? Will you choose to believe in the promise of what is to come?\nChoose to believe that we already have the victory through Christ. Be encouraged that He is with you in whatever battle you currently face and has already won eternal victory for those who trust and believe in Him. He is present in our joy and near in our pain. The Christian walk is not always warm fuzzies. But our joy and our strength don’t need to flee when we stay connected to Jesus.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Jen Yokel\nRecently, I had a chance to catch up over the phone with a friend I’ve known for over 15 years. We hadn’t spoken in a while, but once the conversation got flowing, we were mutually delighted to discover the ways we’d seen God’s constant work in us and our families over the years. Two hours later, I hung up the phone feeling the joy of being known and the encouragement to keep pressing on.\nTo me, this feels like the kind of conversation Paul is having with the church at Thessalonica. Since he had been forced to abruptly leave them, Paul, long separated from this beloved Greek church, was worried about how they were faring under persecution. But in this section of his letter, you can feel his relief to hear they aren’t just surviving, but thriving. They’ve already become well known for their steadfast commitment to the faith and their powerful love for each other.\nSo, what does a spiritual father say to people who are doing well? In other letters, you may see Paul correcting sin or offering education, but in this one, we mostly find delight, encouragement, and a heartfelt blessing to keep going. He celebrates the good they’ve been doing, then pushes them to take that goodness further, praying they increase and overflow with love and that God will “make [their] hearts blameless in holiness” (1Thessalonians 3:13).\n“Blameless” isn’t a word we use too often these days, and if you’re prone to thinking of humans as chronically imperfect, it can sound like a tall order for anyone. In the biblical Greek language, “blameless” means a serious calling to be free of fault, to be perfect, to be so far above reproach no one can say anything bad about you. Paul knows they’ve done well, so now he is calling them to go further as they deepen their love for God and each other, to keep growing and representing Christ in their community, no matter the challenges, persecution, and turmoil they face.\nSo, how do you strive for perfection when the whole world seems to come against you, when life continues to wear you down? Blamelessness, it seems, doesn’t happen through individualistic striving. It calls for living in a tension between actively walking by God’s instruction (Psalm 119:1) and “relying on the power of God” (2Timothy 1:8). Fortunately, we don’t do this alone. This happens in community, too, “as we consider one another in order to provoke love and good works” (Hebrews 10:24). It happens when we listen to each other’s stories for encouragement and support, and it happens when we study God’s faithfulness to the Church across generations and cultures. May that give us all a reason for hope, gratitude, and encouragement.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Sharon Hodde Miller\nThe word “holiness” is one of those terms that, depending on your background, can carry a lot of baggage. For some of us, it’s connected to feelings of guilt and shame, an impossible standard hanging over us. Others associate it with harshness and judgment after hearing it taught legalistically. \nAt first blush, 1 Thessalonians 4 might seem to play into these stereotypes by linking holiness with sexual morality. Paul exhorts the Thessalonians toward holiness by cautioning them from indulging in “lustful passions,” and instead encouraging each person to “control [their] own body” (vv.4–5). Just another Christian prude, our present-day culture might think. However, there is more going on here than first meets the eye.\nFirst is the Thessalonian culture, which is remarkably similar to our own. Many New Testament scholars note that the pagan Thessalonian culture had a liberal view of sexuality. Sex outside the bounds of marriage was not only permissible, but even encouraged.\nThe second thing to note about this passage is the tone. It’s tempting to read instructions about holiness in a thundering voice of condemnation, but that was not Paul’s approach. In verse 1, the Greek word erotao—translated “entreat” or “encourage”—has a connotation of gentleness and friendship. Paul isn’t dropping a hammer of judgment; instead, he is clarifying and affirming a community he loves. \nPaul can see the Thessalonians are living out their faith well. They are honoring Christ with their lifestyles. They are pursuing holiness in every area of their lives. But as they continue to do so, Paul wants them to make a distinction between the teachings of their culture and the teachings of Christ, which diverge on the issue of sexual practice. This context matters, especially in light of popular stereotypes about Christian holiness and sex. For Paul, holiness is not a measuring stick we should use to compare and condemn. By its reckoning, we all fall short.\nStill, “God has not called us to impurity but to live in holiness” (1Thessalonians 4:7)—for our own sake and for His glory. Holiness is our witness. It’s how we point the world to the character of God and proclaim, “This is what God’s love is like.” God’s love is intimate and invested. It is constant and covenantal. It is dignifying rather than degrading. It does not use and abuse. It does not take advantage for a short-lived thrill. It is not rooted in selfish desire but in self-giving faithfulness. Our holy lives bear witness to all these things.\nIn that sense, holiness is not simply about being different or set apart, but reinvigorating the imagination of a world that misunderstands both God and sex. Rather than sneer at our culture and its sexual norms, we can humbly and joyfully point to something better. Our holy lives can serve as the embodiment of God’s best for humanity, a vision of freedom, honor, and dignity.\nHoliness was never meant to be a spiritual bludgeon, and it is much more than a set of boundaries and rules. It is our witness to a world that has forgotten how to live. It is our witness to a world that has forgotten what we are for. And it is our witness to a world that has forgotten what God is like. Everything about us—our bodies, our sex—is a part of that witness. We, the people of God, exist to point people to God. Love is His song, and holiness is the dance.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey Gillespie\nGrowing up, whenever I heard talk of “the second coming,” “the last days,” or “the Day of the Lord,” I’ll admit I felt anything but comfort. In fact, it freaked me out. The apocalyptic imagery from Revelation, and the interpretations of it from churches and books, didn’t set well, and I became afraid, questioning whether or not I was saved. I remember being crouched next to my parents’ bed, repeating some form of the sinner’s prayer to make sure I didn’t get stuck on the wrong side of the Lord’s coming: Jesus, I believe in you. I’m sorry for what I’ve done. Please forgive me. \nAround this time, I also attended my first funeral. It was for a little brown-haired boy, taken early from a family at our church. Although the memorial service was tender, the event left me feeling unwell in my stomach. The truth was this little boy had only “fallen asleep” as the apostle Paul would say (1Thessalonians 4:14–15), but I didn’t yet have enough good theology planted in my adolescent heart to understand why this was a comfort. A sad thing, yes. Grief will also put that feeling inside you. But there was at least comfort in knowing he was with the Lord. \nThankfully, the Holy Spirit has done a lot of healing in my heart since those days crouched next to my parents’ bed. There’s a settled peace inside now. Because of the redemption Jesus brought through His death and life, we aren’t without knowledge about those who pass. We have the promise of hope. \nPaul wrote this first letter to bring comfort to the Thessalonians. The church in Thessalonica misunderstood what happens to those who die. They were confused over the temporary nature of death and, understandably, were grieved and unsettled at the thought of their loved ones missing out on future rest and blessings.  \nBut that wasn’t the message of the gospel. Jesus came to bring eternal life, not eternal death. Correcting their perspective, Paul assured the people of Thessalonica that they were uninformed (v.13). God had not left them to their grief, but had given them hope. Not only would their deceased friends and family rise, but they would rise first (v.16). Can you imagine how this must have alleviated the church’s sorrow? If we choose to exercise faith in Christ, we can secure our hope on the Lord’s return and our eternal home with Him. And we should “encourage one another with these words,” as Paul told the Thessalonians (v.18).   \nComfort, comfort, friends. Those who are asleep will awaken first in the presence of our good Father. Even after we pass from life to death, it isn’t the end. “We will always be with the Lord” (v.17). We’ll be together with our brothers and sisters, experiencing the fullness of God’s love in a collective and embodied way. Together, forever, at last. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Patti Sauls\nDreams are definitely not child’s play. Even now, I have intense dreams—in detail, in color. How about you? Some of my dreams are lovely and make me want to linger in the storyland of sleep. Others are disturbing and jolt me awake. For a moment the fear swirls, but then sweet relief washes over me as I open my eyes and realize the nightmare is not my reality.\nIn his letter to the church he started in Thessalonica, Paul reminded the new believers of the ultimate dream come true: the Day of the Lord, the return of Jesus Christ and His gathering of all believers together, with Him, forever. I love how Paul is sensitive to his friends who would be hearing his letter read aloud. He didn’t shy away from the burning question that was surely on their minds: “When, Paul? When will Jesus come back?”\nPaul did not beat around the bush: “For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night” (1Thessalonians 5:2). It will be sudden and unexpected. He wrote of robbery, destruction, and the onset of excruciating pain like that of a pregnant woman in labor. The dream of Christ’s return suddenly sounded more like a nightmare leaving listeners feeling vulnerable and defenseless.\nWe can’t shy away from the fact that the Day of the Lord is also a Day of Judgment. Every person will be found either in the dark (enslaved to sin and separated from God forever) or in the light (freed from sin and united with God through the death and resurrection of Jesus). Paul is quick to remind and reassure these believers that they “are all children of light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or the darkness” (v.5). They are brothers and sisters in the family of God. They have encountered the truth about Jesus and have responded with repentance and faith.\nHere is sweet relief for every believer from all times and all places. We open our eyes to daylight. The nightmare of judgment is not our reality because Jesus willingly received it as His reality on the cross. Yes, we will be surprised at the timing of Jesus’s return, but we will not be unprepared, groping in the dark. God provides for us.\nIn this letter, Paul also mentions the “armor of faith and love” and the “helmet of the hope of salvation” (v.8). Later, he wrote to the church in Ephesus in more detail about the full armor that God gives to believers for protection and deliverance. God Himself is our defense and provision as He gifts us with truth, righteousness, peace, faith and salvation (Ephesians 6:10–18).\nSurprised, yet safe and fully equipped. By the grace of God, He gives us what we need now and forever. Now that is the ultimate dream come true. Come, Lord Jesus!",

		"devo_summary": "BY Jen Yokel\nPaul’s final benediction to the Thessalonians is a list of instructions for developing Christian character: highly regard your co-laborers with love, comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient with everyone, pursue the good of all, give thanks in everything, test all things, hold on to what is good, and stay away from evil, among other words of advice (1Thessalonians 5:12–22). But these aren’t just rules for the sake of being good. Paul is giving these faithful, early Christ followers a collection of transformative practices to help them deepen their maturity and grow in their faith, practices that have guided generations of believers toward a life that looks like Jesus.\nIt’s notable that this portrait of a believer in hard times isn’t frantic or fearful. They aren’t to be people who strive to solve everything in their own power. They aren’t to be fretting about persecution or disrespect. Instead, this is what it looks like to trust the God who first called them. This is what it looks like to seek the good of each other and the flourishing of community.\nYou may be thinking, How? How can I possibly do all this—comforting the discouraged and pursuing the greater good and giving thanks in everything—when it feels like my world is falling apart? Is this call to be blameless even possible? But here is the good news: you were never meant to do this alone. “He who calls you is faithful. He will do it” (1Thessalonians 5:24).\nIn his book Surrender to Love, David G. Benner compares this sort of reliance on God to learning how to swim. Before you can move through the water, first you have to recognize that you can float. “The English word surrender,” he writes, “carries the implication of putting one’s full weight on someone or something. It involves letting go… And it involves trust.” Floating naturally happens when we stop trying so hard to keep our head above water.\nOf course, there’s nothing wrong with effort. All of these instructions are active practices we should incorporate into our lives as believers. But when we trust God’s faithfulness, we can strive less, knowing the work isn’t wholly dependent on us. Paul’s encouragement is to keep seeking wholeness so that “the God of peace himself” may “sanctify [us] completely” (1Thessalonians 5:23). With the Lord as our confidence, we don’t have to be afraid (Proverbs 3:24–26).\nThere may be times when we wonder if we have the endurance to keep going. We can honor our limits and acknowledge our struggles. But just like learning to swim, we can remind ourselves to float as we learn new strokes, until every movement becomes muscle memory. The work is ours, but it’s also God’s. He called us to it, and He is faithful to finish it.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Lore Ferguson Wilbert\nI tend to focus more on grace when it comes to understanding the gospel. It’s easier for me to focus on how all my sins, infractions, and struggles are covered by the spread of the gospel’s cloak, rather than examining my continued need for grace. Because of Jesus, all my sins have been forgiven, but it seems I’m still looking for loopholes when it comes to actually living as a Christ-follower. \nBy nature, I’m a bit lazy and despise boundaries and constraints, unless they’re of my own making. So, I look for ways around, under, and over the call to Christian living, but rarely through because through is hard—and, well, I don’t like hard. This is why I like to focus on a grace mentality: I can fail hard, all my life, kicking against the pleasant boundaries God has set for me, because I’m still in, still covered by grace.\nBut this emphasis on forgiveness without much understanding or conviction of my continued need for Jesus, is what Dietrich Bonhoeffer called “cheap grace.” This is, as Bonhoeffer put it, “forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline. Communion without confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ.”\nIn other words, when I make the gospel solely about the grace offered to us and not about the ongoing work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, I cheapen the work that has been accomplished on my behalf. I blur over my need to be discipled by Jesus, to learn from and follow His ways. I venture into another form of godlessness where it’s all about me, my performance rather than holiness.\nIn his second letter to the Thessalonians, Paul tells them, “We always pray for you that our God will make you worthy of his calling, and by his power fulfill your every desire to do good and your work produced by faith” (2Thessalonians 1:11). Paul is encouraging the Thessalonians in their call of discipleship under Jesus Christ. It is God who compels and pursues us, guards and guides us, protects and provides for us. He completes the work of salvation by the power of the Spirit, through the work of the Son, and under the care of the Father. This work is by and for and with and about Him—not us. Even my wriggling out of the careful and pleasant boundaries He has laid for me point to His calling and His power (Psalm 16:5–6). We cannot make ourselves fit or worthy of this calling. Only God can do this. \nWhere are you omitting God from the gospel today? How are you making it simply about grace and your own work? Where are you forgetting the wonderful truth that you are both set free by the gospel and made for holy living? His calling, His work, and by His power. The gospel of grace was very good news for the Thessalonian church, as it is for us. This grace is not cheap. You and I were bought with a price (1Corinthians 6:19–20). But this grace is also entirely free by the work and hand of God—for you and for me.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Erin Davis\nIn the Davis home, family meetings are reserved for serious business. If someone calls for one, everyone’s internal radar begins to beep, “Pay attention! This is important!” We sit on the edge of our seats as we gather in the living room to hear whatever weighty news is coming. In 2 Thessalonians 2, the apostle Paul calls a family meeting of sorts. The tone is familial but the topic is kind of scary: even God’s children are vulnerable to deception. \nCan’t you picture the Thessalonians gathering together, family-style to read Paul’s letter? I imagine a few biting their fingernails with worry as they read these words, “Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him: We ask you, brothers and sisters, not to be easily upset or troubled” (2Thessalonians 2:1–2).\nMy heart is right there with the believers who first read these words from Paul. I know I’ve been upset and troubled by the promise of Christ’s coming, even while longing for Him to come. Sometimes I wonder what is taking so long. What if we miss it? How can we know, really know, that when He comes He will receive us as His own?\nBeyond the return of Jesus, I have other worries. I’ve seen my Christian brothers and sisters crash and burn on the runway of wrong theology. I’ve watched church leaders veer from the truth to their own peril. Though I trust my salvation is sealed in Christ, I also know I’m capable of falling for lies and grabbing on to false hopes. We must remember that God knows about our racing pulse and anxious heart (Philippians 4:6). Through His Word, He acknowledges our fears with a paternal warning: “Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way” (2Thessalonians 2:3). \nBut isn’t it the very nature of deception that it’s tricky? And who is the “man of lawlessness” (vv.5–12), and how do we steer clear of the “strong delusion” (v.11) Paul writes about in his letter? \nIn the Davis home, family meetings are also a space for reassurance. We consider something challenging and vow to tackle it together. We acknowledge that something isn’t working, and we stay in the huddle until we have a new game plan. God’s Word does the same. Deep breath. Let’s have a bit of a family meeting.\nHow can we know if we’ve been deceived? Look closely at verse 12. The answer was there all along. Those who are deceived do not believe the truth. They’ve turned from God’s Word. It’s that simple. And it’s also that easy to do, to be swayed by deception.\nSisters, huddle up. Here is the game plan for battling deception. Ready? We hold God’s Word high as the source of truth. Then we love the truth. We live the truth. We run away from every deception, by running toward our Bibles—together. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Abby Flynn\nAs an African-American kid in a predominantly white community, I always knew I was different. But my parents did their best to prepare my siblings and me early on for what life might look like for us as the minority. Yes, we were loved and chosen children of God. But there would be people in the world who wouldn’t like us because of what we looked like. This racial injustice and pain weren’t because God isn’t good. It was because of our humanity, our collective sinful nature, and how the devil often detours our hearts and minds from the truth.\nNow, as an adult with my own kids, I can definitely think of times when I was overlooked, underestimated, or treated differently because of what I looked like. But in times like these, I love Paul’s encouragement to the church at Thessalonica: “Stand firm and hold to the traditions you were taught” (2 Thessalonians 2:15).\nWith these words, Paul is offering the Thessalonians encouragement and a reminder of the greatness of God. Even though they were “outsiders” to much of the rest of the church, “from the beginning” God had chosen them for salvation—all they had to do was believe the gospel and receive God’s grace (vv.13–14). \nBut here’s the catch: being chosen didn’t make them exempt from pain, and the same goes for us. God’s love and Christ’s endurance are available to all believers, and we need both (2Thessalonians 3:5). That’s because in this world we’ll walk through difficult times and places, and we desperately need the hope of Christ in all situations.\nGod is faithful. He watches over His children. He doesn’t promise that everyone will like us, that we’ll be treated fairly, or that we won’t encounter difficulty. But He will give us strength! No amount of sin, pain, trials, or disappointment in your life has the power to change His promises (Proverbs 10:25). It’s not always the right time for us to be exalted. Sometimes we need to experience humility. Sometimes we have to grow through our pain. God works in both ways and at all times (1Peter 5:6).\nFriend, the devil is active, and if we aren’t rooted in Christ, we’re left susceptible to his attacks. The way we combat the devil is by standing firmly in our faith in God.\nAre you experiencing loss? Have you been passed over for an opportunity? Is your family walking through a dark season, facing impossible odds, or wondering how you’ll find the strength to keep going? You are not alone, nor are you abandoned. In fact, you were chosen for salvation. And God will restore, establish and strengthen those who follow Him after their suffering (1Peter 5:10). He still has and He still is the final Word.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Melanie Rainer\nOftentimes, Scripture abounds with rich nuance. It reflects forward and backward, teasing out references to the Old Testament or the New. It can be read in layer after layer, each one peeled to reveal a deeper truth about our relationship to God and His to us. Sometimes, a passage is the opposite: it gives us truth, straight to the point. It tells us how to live, how to love, how to spend our money, how to be saved. \n“Clarity is kindness,” is a phrase I live by, learned from my dearest mentor. In today’s passage from 2 Thessalonians, Paul is delivering the same kindness. There’s nothing nuanced, tucked between flowery phrases, hinting at something only the most educated will understand. Paul serves it straight up: work. Work hard. Don’t be lazy, or idle. And don’t grow weary in doing this good work (2Thessalonians 3:13). \nWork was a creation mandate, established even before the fall. God worked (He created). Adam worked (he named the animals and had dominion over them). And for the rest of time since, the people made in God’s image work and will work. Was Paul talking about a 9-to-5 career, a desk job and an expense account? No, he wasn’t. In fact, the historical Protestant work ethic mixed in with the rags-to-riches American dream has undoubtedly distorted our view of work as a chiefly economic practice. But work is innate to our life and our calling as Christians, whether that work is at a Fortune 500 company, a grocery store, a school, caring for a sick parent, or taking care of a home and children. Paul doesn’t distinguish or categorize work: one type is not better or more righteous than the other. But he is clear on one thing: work matters. \nWork is, in fact, critical to our flourishing as humans. Our witness to the gospel is bound up in our work, in the way we care for others and work for the good of those around us. In his book Every Good Endeavor, Tim Keller writes about work being a “channel of God’s love for his world.” So, if work—be it at home, at a hospital, in a church, or at a restaurant—is a way to carry God’s love outward, it makes sense that Paul would be aghast at idleness. \nWork will bring weariness, pain, suffering, frustration. It will break us, mold us, and tempt us to create idols in our hearts. Work is broken by sin and ungodly motivations, but it still belongs to God. He made us to work, and Paul exhorts us to not grow weary in this good, good work of image-bearing, creating, and serving the God who loves us. He has commissioned us to be His ambassadors in this busy, working world. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Rebecca Faires\nAs I write this, it is snowing outside. All my little boys are in snow pants, and I just saw them eating snow off the back bumper of my van—so, I know they are having lovely, strange snow time. My girls are sleeping; the baby is taking her first nap, and the teenager still hasn’t woken up yet. We don’t often get a blanket of snow in Tennessee, so the sleds tend to appear after a light dusting. I’ve been known to play English carols and light candles if I even smell snow in the night air. Snow looks like peace on earth. It hides all the mud and failing boxwood shrubs. It covers downed bicycles and the dog-trot paths in the woods. Snow frosts our little hilltop like a wedding cake, making everything look clean and quiet and peaceful.\nEventually, the snow melts, ducks and dogs track mud, the baby starts to cry, and I have promises to keep. It’s sumptuous and delightful to feel peace when the snow falls and everything looks peaceful. But boy howdy, circumstantial peace sure is hard to come by. Something is always clanging for your attention, while relationships and cars keep showing up broken. Our peace doesn’t come from a settled home in the snow or a steady income. (You might have to say that out loud.) Our only true peace comes from Christ. He is the Lord of peace, and gives to us generously.\nAnd when Paul writes, “May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way. The Lord be with all of you” (2Thessalonians 3:16), he doesn’t mean, “May your breakfasts be uninterrupted by annoying and unanswerable lizard-based questions, and may your evenings be free of emergencies, both toe and weather-based.” The interruptions and emergencies will not stop. Once the babies stop waking you up at night, the pets will do it—and eventually, the bladder will wake us all. Perfect peace based on circumstances is unachievable. Maybe you’ve enjoyed a perfect breakfast, or even a blissful six-day vacation with your very handsome husband, but that kind of peace doesn’t last. We need peace that transcends the uncontrollable ups and downs of life.\nHonestly, this kind of peace takes away the pressure. “Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6–7). Don’t worry. Pray, and Christ will guard your heart with peace! Snow or hail, filled or hungry, rich or poor—let the peace of Christ rule your heart (Colossians 3:15).",

		"devo_summary": "BY Amanda Bible Williams\nJesus came as the perfect, eternal King.\nThis world is not our home. \nIt’s a statement I’ve heard, and even said, often in my years of growing up in the Church and following Jesus. Sometimes it’s offered as a lament, acknowledging the brokenness and flaws inherent in this earthly life. Other times it’s meant as encouragement, reminding us of the joy and perfection of the eternal life to come. Either way, it testifies to a sort of emptiness, a restlessness—that nagging feeling of incompleteness common to the human experience. C. S. Lewis said it this way in his book Mere Christianity: “If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.”\nAnd he’s right. Scripture teaches that the world cannot fill our God-shaped longings. “I desire nothing on earth but you,” the psalmist cries out (Psalm 73:25). We were made to be in perfect fellowship with God, our Creator, and that perfection is not something we will know until every tear is wiped away and all things are made new. But Scripture also makes it clear that we are here in this imperfect place on purpose and for a purpose; we are part of God’s plan to bring His kingdom to bear on earth. We are written into His redemption story. \nSo, what does that mean for right here and right now? How do we live on earth as citizens of heaven? What does it look like to embrace the already-and-not-yet reality of our permanent home—the kingdom of God—while here in our temporary one?\nIn the first part of this three-week study, we will look to Scripture to better understand Jesus, the King, and the nature of the kingdom of God. Then we’ll spend the remaining two weeks reading about life in the kingdom. Who are its citizens? What are its values, law, and purpose? What does it mean to enter into the kingdom of God while also anticipating it? How does King Jesus call us to live now in light of who He is and all that is to come? \nTruly, there is no one like Him. Jesus came to us as our perfect King (Matthew 21:5), carrying all the authority and power of heaven with Him. Wrapped in flesh, He revealed the very nature of the Father’s love for us (Hebrews 1:3). His is the ultimate kingdom, and He is our forever King, the one who chose to give His life over for us and is now “exalted to the right hand of God” (Acts 2:33). “Therefore let all [God’s people] know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah” (v.36).\nBy God’s grace, may this reality rekindle our passion for following Jesus, as we submit every corner of our hearts and lives to His rule. May we “press on to that other country,” as Lewis said, and “help others to do the same.” This is, after all, what we were made for. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Tameshia Williams\nGod’s kingdom came to reign on earth in a new, decisive way through Jesus.\nAs a young teenager, I often dreamed of living in a faraway world, thanks to my favorite fantasy novels. I spent countless nights reading epic tales of heroes and villains, absently promising my sister/bunkmate lights out after just a few more pages. I longed to escape the realities of my broken world for the “happily ever afters” of my dog-eared paperbacks. I still do. \nJesus invites us to a kingdom that outrivals the most enchanting worlds, real or fiction. We don’t need a portal to transport us to a distant land. Instead, the good and just King has brought God’s kingdom to reign on earth, and we are transformed into His redeemed subjects. The kingdom is here, but not everyone perceives it. \nIn John 18, Jesus stands before Pontius Pilate, rejected by the Jewish leaders as the long-awaited Messiah and presented as a political threat. The scene between the two may seem less action-packed than the rest of Jesus’s Passion week, but the conversation is just as fascinating. The true King is in Pilate’s presence, unrecognized and misunderstood. The accused tells Pilate:\n“I was born for this, and I have come into the world for this: to testify to the truth” (John 18:37). \nPilate does not fully comprehend Jesus’s words. Although they are discussing kingdoms, they are referring to two very different realms. Pilate has in mind a limited, earthly kingdom—Jesus does not (v.36). The kingdom He has in mind is anchored in truth and characterized by righteousness, justice, and peace. \nI was born for this. Jesus didn’t come to overthrow Rome’s government or to reform Jewish leadership. He came to testify to the truth and fulfill God’s will, bringing salvation to the world. He is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (John 1:29). The good news of the gospel is that we belong to Him. Our reality is that we live on earth, but we truly belong to another world, a kingdom that does not belong to this world (John 18:36). This truth transforms us, bringing purpose and hope to the days we spend in this land. \n“You are a king then?” \nPilate asked Jesus this question all those years ago (John 18:37). We can answer this question with certainty. Yes, He is the King… He is our King. His kingdom is here, active and present among us and in us. The journey He has invited us on is more epic than any hero’s tale and more wondrous than any fabled world.  ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey Gillespie\nJesus demonstrated His authority as the true Son of God, who now rules at the right hand of the Father. \nThey sat on a mountain in Galilee, worshiping. There were eleven of them in total, not including Jesus, listening to His words as He drew close. Some of the disciples had their doubts, so Jesus had to reassure them that He was a trustworthy leader. “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth,” He said (Matthew 28:18). If the disciples were going to carry out the Great Commission, teaching others what Christ taught them, they needed to know He was for real. It wouldn’t have been enough simply to spread the sayings of a wise teacher around the world. \nWhen I’m weary of corrupt, worldly leaders and don’t know who to trust, I find so much comfort knowing Jesus is the true King with complete authority. It gives me the deepest sigh of relief. When we look to His leadership, we don’t have to worry about emotional manipulation or strategies to protect His self-image. His reign isn’t abusive or neglectful. It’s fully present and vigilant, just and merciful, all at once. He is the “King of kings and LORD of lords” who entered our world first as a servant and whose kingdom will never end (Revelation 19:16; Philippians 2:7). That’s a leader I want to follow. \nSome days, I confess it’s hard to picture Jesus as my King. I’m so used to the gospel accounts, which tell the story of an everyday-looking man in street clothes, who took strolls by the Sea of Galilee and enjoyed a good plate of food. I’m so used to talking to Jesus like a close friend. Praying to Him from my bed at night, as I pour out my sorrows and joys that only He knows. When I picture our Savior enthroned with a scepter, or some other sign of royalty, I get a little intimidated. Is He really the same? The same tender presence that comforts my broken heart and welcomes my very average piano playing as an offering of worship? \nThe beauty of the gospel is that yes, He is. He’s both. Jesus Christ is our all-powerful King with unparalleled authority, and He’s also the risen Jewish teacher who still has scars on His hands.\nWhat does it mean for Jesus to reign as King today—right now? Whether it feels like it or not, He is already King, and His reign is actively at work. He’s been “given dominion and glory and a kingdom” so all might know and worship Him (Daniel 7:14). But we also know that His kingdom is not fully as it will be when sin, evil, and corruption are weeded out for good. Once this happens, His reign as King will be undeniable by all. Together, we look forward with anticipation to His promised, never-ending rule and reign. I can hardly wait. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Rebecca Faires\nGod’s kingdom is characterized by service, humility, justice, righteousness, joy, and peace.\nA lot of things haven’t gone like I wanted them to. I think I meant to stay skinnier, make more money, and be a world-famous flautist by now. As I was growing up, the world was constantly telling me to stand up for myself, get what was mine, hurt who I needed to hurt in order to make myself feel good. And man, it’s tempting to shake your flute at people and demand your own way. You may not have a flute to wield, but you get the idea. Sometimes, I just want to give a giant tuba toot when someone tells me I can’t get my security deposit back because of what may or may not have happened to a lamp that was ugly in the first place. \nWe want to organize our lives according to the kingdom of the world—a world where we demand what we think is owed to us and where the highest good is money and power. But what if the kingdom of the world is passing away? And what if the only lasting kingdom is God’s upside-down economy? Then everything the world holds dear is dust and ashes and we must look to His kingdom for our hope. \nWhat is the nature of the kingdom of heaven? Scripture gives us a surprisingly rich and wide range of descriptions of God’s kingdom. It is vast, and its prosperity will never end; the zeal of the Lord will accomplish it (Isaiah 9:7). His kingdom brings freedom to captives and healing to the brokenhearted (Isaiah 61:1). It is a comfort and provision to all who mourn (vv.2–3). He will replace shame with a double portion of blessing (v.7). Even now, His kingdom is near and calls for our repentance (Matthew 4:17).\nEach of these descriptions could bear deeper study, but one of my favorites is His promise of healing for the brokenhearted. The kingdom of God is personal and offers profound relief from all the heartbreak of living. Sure, there was a time when I was honestly heartbroken about my flute-related failures, yet there is hope and healing in the kingdom of heaven for even these disappointments. I can put my angry tuba away and stop fighting for myself because He will make all things right.\nThis promise of healing for our deepest, most degrading, and agonizing heartbreaks is the hope the world is longing for. Our most awful pain will be fully healed in the kingdom of heaven. The world is hurting and longing for this truth. We must remember that God loves us and invites us to repent and believe. His kingdom is near, and it is vast, bringing comfort, blessing, and hope. He brings good news to the poor, heals the brokenhearted, brings liberty to captives, and comforts all who mourn (Isaiah 61:1–2). Thanks be to our God and the utter goodness of His kingdom.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Jen Yokel\nHaving been inaugurated through Christ, God’s already-active kingdom will be fully established when Jesus returns. \nIn summer, it’s easy to forget the long slog of late winter. I live in the Northeast, where February paints a world of gray and brown, and March brings even more cold, plus rain and mud. These are the days when deep blue skies and canopies of green feel like a barely remembered dream. And yet, those brighter days are just as real as the cold ones. No matter how lifeless winter trees appear, you can see the promise growing in sleeping buds.\nToday’s reading from Luke reminded me of this truth, but on a much grander, heavier scale. This passage is part of a larger series of Jesus’s teachings in the temple at Jerusalem, shortly before the events leading to His arrest, trial, and death. In these passages, we see Him responding to the challenges to His authority and debating religious leaders on matters practical and philosophical. After making proclamations about  disastrous, future destruction for the temple and Jerusalem, He launches into a dramatic account of the end of the age—of “signs in the sun, moon, and stars,” when “people will faint from fear,” before seeing “the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory” (Luke 21:25–27).\nThroughout the Church’s history, there has been much debate and theological wrestling with what these proclamations mean, and yet, Jesus makes one thing abundantly clear: Frightening things will happen, yet we should not be afraid (John 16:33).\nIt’s the message in Isaiah’s image of the peaceful kingdom. Despite terror and destruction, new life grows from the felled forest. “A shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse” and make all things right, a King we now recognize in Jesus (Isaiah 11:1). We may see fear and destruction as a tragic, yet typical, part of life on earth, but the kingdom of God subverts all that, remaking a world where violence will be undone, where a groaning creation will be liberated (Romans 8:19–21).\nWhen Jesus spoke those words in the temple, He was days away from ushering in this chapter of this renewal story. Jesus inaugurated the kingdom to come, displayed His power and glory, and proved that death and violence don’t have the final word.\nHere’s another interesting fact about trees. Those buds you see in springtime? They were grown in the summer, hidden by flourishing leaves. But we usually don’t notice them until we’re sick of winter and looking for hope.\nMay we, in this never-ending winter of the world, in these cycles of violence and pain and loss, continue to endure without losing heart. May we find the courage to tend the buds of new creation through our love and peacemaking, watching and waiting for the day they burst into life without end.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Melanie Rainer\nPeople from every nation will share in Jesus’s kingdom inheritance and mission. \nFor Lent this year, my daughters and I set a goal to read an entire storybook Bible together. Each night, we curled up on the couch, and my husband or I read a chapter or two to them. I love watching them see how all the stories fit together, telling one story that is also our story. Abraham had no family, but God made him one. That family became a people, who God called His own. They had no land, but God promised them one. They had no king, so God gave them one. And on and on the story goes, of disparate people bound together by the love of their good God. Now all believers are the heirs of all those promises, which Jesus fulfilled and will fulfill completely, for all time, when He returns to reign as King. \nToday’s readings come from throughout Scripture, the Old Testament and the New, from Paul’s letters to John’s final Revelation. And they tell the whole story, tying up loose ends, asides, and confusing metaphors: the story of God’s people, Jews and Gentiles, and the redemption accomplished on the cross by Jesus, unifying them forever. Here, in Revelation 1, we see the sweeping scope of Scripture in two verses:\nTo him who loves us and has set us free from our sins by his blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father—to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen (Revelation 1:5–6).\nFrom the beginning in Genesis, God loved us. The book of Hosea reminds us of the plan He always had, to call a people who were not a people His own (Hosea 2:23). Peter later uses this same language: “Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people” (1Peter 2:10). \nIn Romans and Ephesians, Paul paints a picture of the unity of Christ’s followers: the diverse, vast, deep, wide, and encompassing body of people who are loved by God. He calls us words like “children,” “heirs” and “co-heirs,” “sons,” “fellow citizens” and “priests” to describe the Jews and Gentiles unified through Jesus into one family, one inheritance of glory (Romans 8). \nThe unity is hard-won, however, and incomplete until the day Jesus returns. The body of Christ is fractured, as it has been since Paul and Peter argued with other believers at the Jerusalem Council over how Gentile believers were to behave now that they had become followers of Jesus (Acts 15). \nChurch history is replete with examples of church councils and conflicts, denominational splits and debates. We hole up with our theological tribes and shoot arrows at each other from our keyboards, forgetting that Scripture is the story of God calling us together into His kingdom—and that our job isn’t to win the fight, but to pursue the peace that Jesus won for us on the cross. \nWhen we read Revelation 5, God reminds us that our future home is not full of people who look, think, act, read, or believe exactly how we do. In fact, Jesus secured the opposite by His blood: a beautiful, diverse kingdom from every tribe, language, people, and nation, unified forever by the God who loves them all as His own (Revelation 7:9–10).",

		"devo_summary": "BY Kaitie Stoddard\nThe upside-down nature of the kingdom reframes our understanding of human struggles.\nSearch “#blessed” on social media and you’ll find countless photos of tropical vacations, elaborate meals, and designer clothes. Apparently, success, health, and material wealth are the things our western world has declared a blessing.\nYet, Jesus had an entirely different definition for the word “blessing.” Early in Christ’s ministry at the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave His disciples a glimpse of the upside-down nature of His Father’s kingdom, saying, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs” (Matthew 5:3). He went on to say that those who mourn, those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, and those who are persecuted because of righteousness are the truly blessed (vv.4,6,10).\nEven as Christ’s followers, we might be scratching our heads wondering how poverty, sadness, and suffering can be anything but bad. But God often takes what the world sees as “bad” and declares it “blessed.” But what could be so good—so #blessed—about being “poor in spirit”?\nTo be “poor in spirit” does not mean to be financially impoverished, but as the great evangelist Billy Graham said, think of it as being “humble” in spirit. We must have the humility to recognize that we are nothing without God. The proud cannot admit that they need God, and so they cannot take the steps of repentance and belief. This is why only the “poor in spirit” will inherit the kingdom of God. Only the humble can acknowledge their spiritual lack and profess a life-saving faith in Jesus.\nI’m guessing we’d all love to be heirs to the kingdom of God, but how do we become “poor in spirit”? Look at the example of James and John, two beloved disciples of Christ who struggled with pride. They wanted to be the greatest of Jesus’s followers and sit next to Him in heaven. They even had the audacity to ask Him for exactly that, through their mother, that is (Matthew 20:20–21). Christ’s question to James and John in return can be asked of us too: “Are you able to drink the cup I drink?” (v.22).\nWe know that “the cup” Jesus referred to came with a cost. The Father called His own Son to a painful death, before raising Him up again into the forever kingdom. If we want to be resurrected with Jesus, we must first be crucified with Him.\nAs citizens of God’s kingdom, we can see through the lies of this world. Superficial comforts are not signs of the Lord’s blessing, and a lack of wealth and health are not signs of God’s judgment. Rather, the one who grows in humility and hunger for God, often through trials, is the one who is truly blessed.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Rebecca Faires\nOur relationship to the Old Testament law is changed in Jesus, who fulfills the law and clarifies the ethics that characterize the kingdom.\nMy last name is Faires. It’s pronounced “Ferris.” Yes, like Ferris Bueller. Or “ferrous,” as in something containing iron. Not “fairies,” like a group of woodland sprites. Nor is it “fairs,” like the plural of an event involving both cotton candy and hogs. And the plural of Faires (no matter how I try to avoid it by patiently writing out “The. Faires. Family.”) just has to be Faireses. This is a mouthful and, honestly, more of the letter “s” than I’d like to see before I’ve had my morning coffee. This occasionally leads to us being introduced not as the scribes, but as the “The Fairesees.” And I want to tell you that we (a little bit) deserve it.\nNo matter how well I comprehend the doctrines of grace, I still give myself a smug little “well done” if I manage to maintain a holy composure for one entire church service. It’s so easy for me to get distracted from the goodness of the Lord by the purported goodness of Rebecca. Are you, too, tempted to revel in your own rule-following and self-proclaimed goodness? \nThe Pharisees were excellent rule-followers. They loved rules so much they made up extra ones. They had rules for everything. And they didn’t just stick with the Ten Commandments. They had a multitude of additions, subpoints, and expansions. And they were serious about each of them. They instructed others that this was how people merited heaven: by keeping the Law and the traditions.\nAnd works-to-righteousness legalism is so appealing on the surface, because finally it feels like there’s something we can do to secure salvation for ourselves. The problem with legalism is that while it seems to uphold the law to a serious degree, it actually undermines it.\nThis is why Jesus was opposed to the supposed “righteousness” of the Pharisees. But He rejected their legalistic notions in a peculiar way. You’d think that the way to reject legalism would be to swing to the opposite perspective: antinomianism, or the rejection of rules altogether. The Pharisees thought the keeping of the Law would save them. Antinomians thought the law was not worth a second thought, and that grace would save them no matter what degrading sins they could dredge up. \nBut Jesus said: “I did not come to abolish [the Law] but to fulfill” it (Matthew 5:17). Jesus rejects both a legalistic and an antinomian use of the Law. The law of God—not the heaped-up additions of men—must be fulfilled to the fullest degree. The law must pierce our hearts and change not only our external behavior, but our every thought and attitude. The law must be fulfilled perfectly: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). What an impossible standard!\nThe Pharisees, in truth, made little of the true Law, but made much of their own law-keeping. Christ came to fulfill the Law perfectly, so that repentant Pharisees and antinomians like you and me could have peace with God.",

All of these practices are meaningful, yet He urges the audience to examine their motives and do this work in secret, where “your Father who sees in secret will reward you” (Matthew 6:4).\nIn His parables, Jesus often portrays the kingdom of God as a place of enough, where the Giver of good things makes sure we have everything we need. Could that be true of the approval we crave too?\nWe live in a world where the scarcity mindset rules. We are tempted to worry about fairness. In our small talk, we field questions about jobs and marital status and children. In our free time, we scroll through social media and play the comparison game, whether we mean to or not. For inspiration, we turn to our favorite influencers for a glimpse of the good life, looking for the home decor, the clothes, the exercise routine that might finally bring us contentment.\nBut imagine a kingdom where all have enough. Where we don’t have to jockey for position, where we don’t have to announce ourselves to get the affirmation we deeply long for. This is the kingdom of God, where the lowly are raised up, where our smallest offering, given in earnest, is enough. This is true for our outward actions and our spiritual lives.\nLater, Jesus tells a story “to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else” (Luke 18:9). Two men, a Pharisee and a tax collector,  are praying. One is counted among the highest, holiest men in Jewish culture. The other is regarded with a sneer, labeled a sellout to the empire. One prays, “God, I thank you that I’m not like other people—greedy,unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector” (Luke 18:11). The other pleads, “God, have mercy on me, a sinner!” (v.13). Jesus’s point is clear on who went home justified that day (Matthew 26:36–46).\nThis isn’t to say that all acts of goodness need to be completely secret. Sometimes, the best gift we can give is to pray out loud for a friend in distress. Sometimes welcoming others into our fasting can open the door to mutual strengthening and encouragement. Jesus’s goal is not to heap rules and guilt onto our spiritual lives, but rather invite us to walk with Him, embracing God’s kingdom lifestyle.\nIn all of this, it’s the motives that matter. When we give, pray, and fast, when we choose to seek God’s approval more than our fellow travelers,’ we open our hands to release the security we cling to and accept God’s provision. We can rest in knowing every need will be met, and in the end, there is more than enough.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nOur priority is to seek the kingdom over earthly possessions, replacing worry with trust in God’s provision.\nI thought I was a relaxed hostess until I began hosting playdates with toddlers, a fun time where order and clean surfaces go to die! I tell myself that my belongings don’t matter, but when it comes down to it, the chaos of a group of three-year-olds can feel like a personal threat to my home and self-preservation. \nAs I read today’s Scripture from Matthew, I paused and asked myself, What does it mean to store up “treasures in heaven”? What is Jesus actually asking me to do? The Scripture seems to focus less on actual possessions and more on the posture of the heart (see Matthew 19:16–22). Anything that stands in the way of us fully following and trusting in God is an area of our hearts we ought to examine. Matthew writes: \nBut store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (Matthew 6:20–21). \nWhat is “treasure” in heaven, from a kingdom perspective? It’s living for God’s glory and the good of others (Hebrews 6:10). Because God provides for His people and “delights to give [us] the kingdom,” we are free to pursue the good of other people, to focus on relationship with our Heavenly Father and those He has surrounded us with (Luke 12:32). No thief can steal love that has been freely given (v.33). \nMy heart’s posture toward loving and serving others in my home takes an ugly turn when I begin to focus on my possessions, my appearance, and my control. Perhaps it’s a simple example, but it’s very real to me. When I become angry, bitter, and frustrated with my son for making a mess, I know it’s my comfort and my possessions that I’m actually concerned about. When adults are invited into my home and feel welcome enough to casually move furniture around without asking, my heart reveals its desire to control and maintain order. The sin in my heart gets in the way of hospitality, of pursuing the good of others. I want to offer a space where people feel comfortable and loved. When I’m too consumed by the outside mess, how can I possibly minister to the mess we all bring with us? \nSo, yes, even little people in my sphere of influence (the home) need to know the patience and gentle instruction of God. Friends need to see the generosity of Jesus when we serve them in our home. I should worry less about shoes on the couch when our family is rich in relationships. God knows what we need to get through this physical, day-to-day world. He provides the necessary things for us, so we can focus on making the kingdom of God very real to the people here on earth. Couches fade and, believe it or not, you can get diet soda out of your rug with just hot water (and silent prayer). But ultimately, being present with people and sharing Jesus’s love with them are the kind of treasures I want to store up.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Melanie Rainer\nJesus describes what it means to enter the kingdom.\nI adore the poetry of Robert Frost. I love his embedded New Englandism, as steady as its granite mountains, and his command of simple syntax. Perhaps his most famous poem is known for a line you’ll likely recognize, one that conjures the image of two roads diverging in a yellow wood. “The Road Not Taken” ends with this stanza:\nI shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.\nThis poem has been oft debated and never settled, and despite its cultural fame, only Frost knows what his original intent was. Its open-endedness is one of the gifts of poetry, one that offers acres for our minds to wander without much of a map. But the poem’s imagery of “two roads” can help lead us into today’s readings by envisioning a stark choice. These passages include several teachings of Jesus that, in essence, pose the questions: “Will you follow me? Which road will you take: the narrow, or the wide?” (Matthew 7:13). \nThere are theological tomes written about each of these stories: the “ask, seek, knock” passage, the two foundations of sand and rock, the parables of the wheat and weeds and of the wedding banquet. There are certainly more nuances and jewels buried in these stories than I may ever have time to learn in this life. But the driving beat in each song is the question of whether we will choose to follow Jesus.\n“Will you come to church?” and “Will you be a good person?” are not the questions being asked. It’s much starker and harder than that: Will you follow Jesus in His kingdom? And will your life be fundamentally changed, bearing good kingdom fruit?\nThese stories offer us a warning and an invitation to take the narrow path toward Jesus, though it won’t be easy. It will cost us a lot in this world: comfort, pleasure, wealth, self-sufficiency, and myriad other things. And our choice, as Jesus says repeatedly, is not a verbal one. It will show in our actions, of how we love others the way He loves them. \nBut the good news is that when we follow Jesus on the narrow path, we do not walk alone. The Holy Spirit will be our guide, sealing and securing our place in the kingdom. God’s Word will be “a lamp for [our] feet and a light on [our] path” (Psalm 119:105). And the hardest work, opening the door to the kingdom, has already been accomplished by Jesus. He forged a path to God when it was overgrown with sin; all we have to do is follow Him down the path He has revealed to us. A path where in His presence there is abundant joy, and at His right hand are eternal pleasures (Psalm 16:11). ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nWhile we wait for Christ’s return, the Spirit equips us to live faithfully in light of our redemption in Christ.\nMost of us have experienced a nightmare in which we arrive for a work presentation or a school exam unprepared. It doesn’t matter if you haven’t been to school in a decade or to work in weeks—the panic of being unprepared sets in, and you wonder how you could have forgotten to study or do the work necessary to perform well. For me, I wake up in a state of stress and don’t calm down until I realize the scenario isn’t real.\nThe parable of the ten virgins feels like this nightmare. How could the five, foolish virgins not have been prepared to meet the groom? They obviously knew what needed to be prepared, yet they were foolish enough to forget to bring plenty of oil with them to keep their lamps burning until he arrived.\nWe should heed the warning that comes with a life not prepared to glorify Christ daily and welcome His return. We don’t want to miss the kingdom of God at work in this world today or the return of our bridegroom Jesus.\nThe five, wise virgins who came prepared with extra oil for their lamps remind me of a woman who is living a life of “holy conduct and godliness” (2Peter 3:11). Though she may not know the hour of her groom’s return, she endures the wait. Easier said than done, I know. For a follower of Jesus, His coming kingdom can sometimes feel like a mystery too difficult to understand and a promise that seems too far away to actualize.\nThankfully, the mystery has been made known: “You know the way I am going,” Jesus tells His disciples (John 14:4). Jesus Himself has gone before us, prepared a home for us, and will lead us. He reassures His disciples, saying, “Don’t let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me” (v.1). We can rest now, knowing that kingdom-living is not impossible because we have assurance for our future place in God’s kingdom and the Holy Spirit to help us live faithfully today.\nWe are asked to wait, trusting in Jesus’s promise. Peter tells the church that “based on [Jesus’s] promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness dwells… Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found without spot or blemish in his sight, at peace” (2Peter 3:13–14). Let’s be women who are prepared—not anxious for the future because we walk with Jesus who presents us as a spotless bride, but eager with anticipation as we wait for our bridegroom to lead us to the banquet table.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey Gillespie\nAs followers of Jesus, our allegiance is to the King, and His kingdom is our priority. Submitting to Christ as King is an act of worship.\n“If anyone wants to follow after me,” said Jesus to His disciples, “let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23). \nDeny yourself. Ooph. It’s one of those statements that cuts straight into me. Nothing in me likes the thought of denying myself. It creates the feeling of lack and I don’t like to feel the cavernous growl any more than the unfulfilled desires of my heart.  \nReading today’s passages, I had to ask myself the honest question: as a follower of Jesus, what does it even mean to deny myself? Or pick up my cross? (After those first two, the questions kept on coming.) How do believers practice the kind of self-denial Jesus talked about without being doormats or shadows of who God created us to be? How do we avoid self-erasing and abuse, while, at the same time, also avoid idolizing self-care or, as my friend likes to put it, “building the kingdom of me”?\nOur allegiance must be to our King. If you look at verse 25, Jesus also says, “For what does it benefit someone if he gains the whole world, and yet loses or forfeits himself?” (or “soul” as some translations say). Denying ourselves isn’t about losing our God-given identity. What Jesus is saying is that instead of going after our own agendas, we should seek first the kingdom.\nTo do this, we must look to Jesus again. In the full passage from Luke 9, Jesus isn’t talking about self-imposed pain in an effort to be holier. We weren’t called to be hermits or doormats without boundaries. But we are told to expect trials in our day-to-day lives and to face them head-on for the sake of our greater calling.  \nAs believers, our citizenship is in heaven (Philippians 3:20). Even though it’s right and good to thank God for the many amazing gifts He gives us, we want to be careful about developing a love for the world and our own comfort over our love for Christ (1John 2:15). Instead, our devotion and allegiance should be to our first love. \nThere will be days when we’re asked to give up a lot. A whole lot. There may be years that feel like we’re waiting for a harvest that isn’t coming. Life will require great endurance. That’s a promise. But there will also be beauty and the deep satisfaction of partnering with our King in His mission to redeem and restore our world. This is the tradeoff for denying ourselves and taking up our cross. We share in the sufferings of Christ, but we also get to share in the joy. Keep following Jesus, friends. It’s worth it. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Tameshia Williams\nOur King calls us to share in His kingdom work and participate in its growth.\nJesus’s parables are diverse in length and content. Some last for several paragraphs; others are mere one-liners. Whatever the length or topic, He used the metaphors of each parable to drive home the truth of God’s Word. Today’s reading includes one of those shorter word pictures used to describe God’s kingdom. \n“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field” (Matthew 13:31). Throughout the Gospels, Jesus constantly shows us what His kingdom looks like and what it doesn’t. The upside-down kingdom functions in ways that are uncharacteristic of this world. God’s kingdom is great and powerful, and we’d expect a more appropriately sized seed to represent it instead of the smallest of them all. Yet Jesus uses the imagery of the mustard seed to show us what His kingdom looks like. It starts small, Jesus says, but it continues to grow and grow.  \nSince the days of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19–20), God’s kingdom has expanded exponentially. Just as He charged Peter and company to make disciples, Jesus calls us to share in His kingdom work and participate in its growth. Kingdom work is not exclusive to those with official church titles; it is the privilege of all believers. What a diverse—unified, but diverse—group of people we are. We all have different gifts that God uses to promote growth and harmony in the Church body (Ephesians 4:16).\nWhen we share the gifts that God has given us with each other and with the world, we allow His power to work in us, transforming all. It isn’t our efforts or inner genius that produce results. It is all God, working through us to share the good news of the kingdom in various ways, powered by His Spirit. \nKingdom work doesn’t equate to easy work. We are kingdom people, but our bodies and minds remain tethered to this earth. That means sin, with all its devastation and brokenness, is still present and active. In the midst of this brokenness God calls us to grow together and bring His example to the world (1Peter 2:11–12). No, kingdom work isn’t easy work. But as my boss often says, it is worth-it work.\nWhat gifts has God given us? None are too small, none too insignificant—like the mustard seed. Let’s continue to ask the Lord for insight into how we can encourage and challenge each other as we grow and work together in His kingdom.",

Year after year, I’d recycle my “research” for the annual biography project (subject: always Einstein). I really loved the art portion of the assignments, getting to draw his wild, unruly hair and cheeky twinkle in the eye, perhaps that tongue he used to wag at the camera. Today, photographs of him reveal more wariness than my youth was trained to see. Life grows complicated, as the scientist certainly knew.\nWell-acquainted with scientific research himself, Einstein is often credited with this little ditty: “Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.” Now, to my knowledge, Einstein didn’t give much credence to religion of any sort—only God Himself knows his heart. Still, Einstein’s point applies to spiritual life in general, doesn’t it? The tangible “stuff” we look to accumulate on this side of eternity may be counted and stacked, displayed and gazed upon with self-admiration, but we can’t take it with us to the other side of eternity. That stuff does not translate there, doesn’t travel well, so to speak. \nThe things that really do count and matter most are not so easily quantified. I cannot take a photograph of the countless conversations that have drawn me closer to Jesus. Those who’ve prayed for me in earnest may have nothing tangible to show for it. Messy and imperfect though it may be, the Christian community I’ve experienced through deep comfort and gentle rebuke bears no trophy for the faithful. Their wisdom and kindness, their care and casseroles, their tears—the world gives no prizes for these. But not so in God’s kingdom! \nGod’s kingdom may not be seen or accounted for in the ways this world asks of it, but kingdom things can still be felt and experienced, can’t they? They are discerned and perceived through the lenses of humility and wonder. They are realized in the way we love one another and the world, the way we long for gospel truth to be known. This is how we practice and experience the presence of our King and the fullness of His kingdom today.\nWe can know as much about this physical world as Einstein, but miss the Designer for the design. What are we missing as we strive to accumulate accolades and wealth that we cannot take with us and do not advance God’s purposes? \nWe are meant for so much more. He “has made us a kingdom and priests to our God, and [we] will reign on earth” one day (Revelation 5:10). We have yet to experience the immeasurable fullness of God’s kingdom, but the fullness of God Himself and His love are already ours (Ephesian 3:17–19). He has come and will come again in grandeur—we will see Him face to face! (1Corinthians 13:12; Revelation 22:4). For now, His kingdom has come in us. May it be on earth as it is heaven. Amen.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Tameshia Williams\nOur weekly company meetings always include prayer on the agenda—a true perk of working at a faith-based company. During that time, we pray for each other and for those who are connected to us, our family and friends. We also pray for all those who might be reached by what we do, including our fellow believers. The New Testament has no shortage of verses instructing us to pray for one another. And in Paul’s letter to the Colossians, the apostle shows us something else we should do when we go to God on behalf of one another.  \nMany times, when I read Paul’s letters, I’m tempted to dismiss the opening verses as mere greetings. But all of God’s Word is for us, and the content of Paul’s greeting to the Colossians prompts us to do more than just pray for our fellow believers. We ought to celebrate their faith and give thanks for them.\nIn chapter 1, Paul communicates to the Colossians that he and Timothy “always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you” (Colossians 1:3). Even though Paul had not met the Colossian believers face to face, he prayed for them and thanked God for them. Why? Because of their faith and the love they expressed toward the saints because of the gospel (v.4).  \nWe are far removed from the first century, but Jesus’s good news of salvation has continued to spread throughout the world, as He said it would, and it has continued to produce fruit (Matthew 24:14; Colossians 1:6). Praying for other believers helps us to remember the far-reaching power of the gospel and the broader narrative of Scripture: the redemption of peoples across all times and in every generation.\nWhile God’s household certainly includes our own circle of Christian community, it also extends far beyond it to believers on every continent. We all share in God’s grace, united by His Spirit. This is the heart of Paul’s message in Colossians, and as we’ll also see in Philemon, it calls us to live transformed lives, lives that reflect the love of Jesus, the one who saved us and longs to offer “redemption, the gift of forgiveness” to all of humanity (Colossians 1:14; Isaiah 30:18). That is reason enough to rejoice and celebrate the reach of the gospel to our brothers and sisters from every corner of the earth.\nThe gospel fuels our love and passion toward the believers who are in our own lives (Colossians 1:4–5). When we pray for each other, which should be often, God brings our thoughts, motives, and actions into alignment with His own. With an attitude of thanksgiving, we should pray for the Lord’s will to be done in all things.\nThe good news of the gospel is also this: God has saved us from our sin and extended His redemption to people all across the globe. We rejoice over each other—not because of anything we have done but because of the gift the Father has so generously given through His Son, the Spirit given to comfort and guide us, and fellowship with one another. And because of our well-placed hope in Him (v.5), we can look forward to the day when all of God’s people, from every nation and generation, will rejoice in Jesus Christ together. As the hymn says, “What a day of rejoicing that will be!”",

		"devo_summary": "BY Patti Sauls\nI guess it was inevitable. All my life, I had 20/20 vision. Distant street signs? No problem. Small print on a menu? I’ve got this. But then I turned forty. As eyestrain and blurriness became my new normal, I realized how much I had taken the gift of clear vision for granted. Now I have eyeglasses scattered throughout my home and car as I squint to see things up close and far away. Good times.\nToday’s passages remind us that, without Jesus, our spiritual vision is impaired too. On our own, we strain as we consider who God is and how we can be close to Him. Can I know God? Does God really love and accept me? Can I trust Him? The answers to such honest, human questions shape our faith and lives, yet they often seem blurry.\nPaul wanted the church in Colossae to see truth clearly. They had started with gospel clarity, seeing Jesus as the only one able to reconcile sinful people to a holy God, “by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross” (Colossians 1:20). But false teachers were misleading the church. They were instructing the Colossians to rely on their own efforts and enlightenment for right standing with God, instead of relying on the finished work of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. The issue was a Christ-centered worldview versus their self-centered worldview, which is a futile, tiring way to live.\nTruth was being twisted and blurred, so Paul urged the Colossians to look to Christ. Relying on Christ alone was the only way to see and experience God with clarity and certainty. “[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation” (v.15). Jesus is the very image of God because He is God. When we look to Jesus—how He lived, how He loved, how He forgave, how He sacrificed to restore broken, lost people—we see how God relates to us.\nLooking to Christ is like putting on eyeglasses so we can see God and ourselves more clearly. Looking to Christ means seeing and embracing the truth that He is Creator and King of every single thing in all creation—including our salvation, the daily ups and downs of our lives, and the state of the entire world.\nTo be sure, our vision is impaired and life can be a blur: morning-rush meltdowns, job hassles, relationship tensions, deep disappointments, fear of the future. We strain for clarity and control. But let us “not [shift] away from the hope of the gospel” (v.23). Is blurriness about God’s power and love becoming your new normal? Are you feeling the strain of relying more and more on yourself to push through each day? Put on your eyeglasses! Look to Christ and rely on Him. Rest in Him.\nJesus, you see, rule, and restore all of your creation. Help us rely on You, to trust You to restore our sight too. Restore our vision of Your power and love. Amen.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Melanie Rainer\nI recently started following an account on Instagram that shows me the same news story with three different headlines: one that is left-leaning, one right-leaning, and one centrist. While I know that all stories (news, personal, or historical) are written and shared with implicit narrator bias, this account has opened my eyes to the subtleties of bias. I’ve seen how just one word can shift an entire perspective from relatively neutral to slanted. \nThis happens in my own life, too, of course. I can hardly tell a story, make an argument at work, or even ask my husband a question without my own perspective infiltrating my statements. This is human nature. We come at every interaction with an angle that is rooted in our own insecurities or emotional responses. \nWhen Paul writes to the Colossians, particularly in chapter 2 to call out the tempting Colossian heresy, he is exposing this idea: wisdom has become personal, not absolute. (I think it’s more than safe to say this is as true today as it has been throughout history.) Many scholars believe the heresy Paul was addressing was rooted in gnosticism. The Greek word gnosis means “secret knowledge,” and the gnostics believed that this secret knowledge would be the source of salvation and faith. \nPaul wants the Colossians to “have all the riches of complete understanding and have the knowledge of God’s mystery—Christ. In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:2–3). He wants them to know that the true source of all wisdom and knowledge of God is Jesus. There is no complicated, secret truth that is available to only the most enlightened among us. Jesus is ‘the way, the truth and the life”—the only way to know God (John 14:6). \nLike us, the Colossians were tempted to believe that there was something special or extra they could do to know more or be better Christians. So often today, we are tempted to believe that if we read all the right books and listen to all the right podcasts, somehow we’ll have all the answers. While those things can be wonderful and good, if that is all we are absorbing, we can easily be lulled into seeking personal wisdom, rather than the wisdom of eternal God.\nPaul has just as much to say to us today as he did the Colossians: Jesus is the absolute source of wisdom. Jesus has the true and perfect knowledge of God. There isn’t more to it than that. Know Jesus, and through Him know God. And how do we know Jesus? Through His Word. Through seeking Him and communing with Him by His Spirit. My hope and prayer is that the more I study the Word and seek to know Christ, the more my perspective will be shaped by Him—and less by me.",

You’re the defendant and you’re as guilty as the day is long. Your crime was heinous. Your denial, futile. Every piece of evidence has worked like a nail in your coffin. There’s no chance of acquittal. With sweaty palms and a racing heart, you wait to hear the gavel drop with the finality of your conviction. But then—it doesn’t. The judge offers you a pardon instead. \nGo ahead, feel your shoulders drop. Breathe the breath you’ve been holding inside your chest. Your conviction has been overturned. Your undeniable guilt is stricken from the record. Wonder anew at the beautiful truth that instead of a gavel, you’ve been given the gospel. Your conviction has been overturned. Your undeniable guilt is stricken from the record. Because of Jesus, you’ve moved from incarcerated to liberated, from the death sentence to the promise of life eternal. \nGod’s Word is clear: we will have our day in court (Hebrews 9:27). Judgment is an inescapable reality. But consider carefully who has the right to sit on the bench. It is Jesus who “disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly, he triumphed over them in him” (Colossians 2:15). \nWe’ve all violated God’s perfect law. If sin is in the judgment seat and death in the jury box, we will be found guilty. But Hallelujah! No one has the right to judge us but Jesus. And because of Him, sin and death have no claim over us. “For the entire fullness of God’s nature dwells bodily in Christ, and you have been filled by him, who is head over every ruler and authority” (v.9). \nChild of God, sin has no authority to rule you because Christ reigns inside of you. Death has no right to accuse you because Jesus conquered death for you. Every authority that could condemn you was defeated by Christ’s death and resurrection. The apostle Paul says it beautifully: “[Jesus] erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross” (v.14).  \nThis is our gospel hope. The jury has been dismissed. No one else has jurisdiction here—only our Savior. The only authority that remains is Jesus. He knows we deserve condemnation, yet He offers us grace instead. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Rebecca Faires\nMy favorite homeschooling outfit is a warm pair of long blue socks, pulled up to my knees, where they joyfully meet my short sweatpants, combining for an overall effect that my husband calls, “The Francis Schaeffer Look.” If your beauty doesn’t spark in your husband’s mind a comparison to modern Christian apologist and enthusiastic knicker-wearer Francis Schaeffer, is the flame even still burning in your marriage? \nReally, I’m not in bad company. Schaeffer famously argued, “Regardless of a man’s system, he has to live in God’s world.” It can be a tricky thing, living in this world, don’t you think? We are tempted to act like we’re in charge here—like we’re running the show and the whole world belongs to us. It doesn’t. This is God’s world, and we are here to glorify Him. \nThis world tells us to work harder and be smarter, to say all the right things at just the right time, to wear fashionable hosiery (something other than, say, blue knee-high socks). We can attempt to apply this system to our faith, to try to do more to make ourselves just a little more worthy of God. But this is treating the world as ours, to be managed and regulated as we humans think it ought to be run. \nThis is the lie some Colossians were being persuaded to believe. Paul’s rebuke in this letter against legalism, righteousness by works, self-made religion and asceticism is speaking against the false teachers in Colossae who had forgotten the true gospel, that Christ alone is our justifier (Colossians 1:12–23; Romans 3:26). “Therefore,” Paul instructs, “don’t let anyone judge you in regard to food and drink or in the matter of a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day,” or any other regulation (Colossians 2:16).\nYou can almost hear Paul’s frustration, “If you died with Christ to the elements of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations: ‘Don’t handle, don’t taste, don’t touch’?” (Colossians 2:20–21). Instead of trying to follow the world’s instructions, we are called to pursue the Lord, and seek what He loves. Jesus promises wisdom from above, and the fruit of His wisdom “is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without pretense. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who cultivate peace” (James 3:17–18).\nPaul reminds us there is true freedom in this: We belong to Christ. While we live in this fallen world in need of grace, we belong to another King and His kingdom. We can be free of the tyranny of the rules of this world, by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey Gillespie\nAt the beginning of the year, I noticed a trend of people pushing back against the phrase, “New year, new you.” The takeaway was simple: Don’t be so dramatic. You don’t need a brand new you. Just keep showing up to the life you already have, one day at a time. Keep living, keep loving other people, and keep growing alongside the rest of us.  \nTrust me—I get the draw to a fresh start. I get why we crave an entirely new prototype that paves the way for what the past failed to deliver on. We want to believe that what kept us from being our healthiest selves last year doesn’t have to control us anymore, so we burst into the new year, fists out, ready and raring to go. I, for one, am grateful God doesn’t start from scratch each year. Instead, He renews us continuously (Colossians 3:10). He makes all existing things new. And, fortunately, He doesn’t need January 1 to help Him out with that. \nThe third chapter of Colossians describes a different kind of new life, or “new you.” Rather than focusing on self-improvement with workout routines, healthy eating, or financial freedom, this new life Paul describes is a holistic overhaul of our old way of being. It is a call to accept the invitation to live out our identity in Christ, the one whose blood has already made us new.   \nThe hardest work is already done! Scripture says those raised with Christ have put off the old self and put on the new (Colossians 3:1,9–10). Our old ways die, and our new life is “hidden with Christ in God” (v.3). In this sense, the Christian life is a moment-by-moment renewal where we actively choose to leave our old ways behind, the ones controlled by sin and death, and walk in Christ. The invitation greets us each morning, along with the sunrise. \nOne of the beautiful side effects of this new life is an increased awareness of others. It softens us toward our brothers and sisters and allows us to be the hands and feet of Jesus. When we are hidden in Christ, we can bring His life-changing love to our friends and family—and especially, those we want nothing to do with. It definitely won’t feel good at times. But this is the new you, after all. Not the old one. This is Christ in you.   \nToday, instead of aspiring to culture’s self-improvement mantras, let’s clothe ourselves in the same love, compassion, and forgiveness we’ve been shown. Our spiritual lives, after all, are lifelong journeys where each day we’re invited deeper into the heart of God and the abundant life He offers. Together as people captured by the heart of Jesus, may we “seek things above, where Christ is” (v.1). May we seek the kingdom of God first (Matthew 6:33). This is the only way to become truly new.   ",

		"devo_summary": "BY Rebecca Faires\nI have to wash the dishes this morning. Last night we ate fresh bread with butter, roasted chicken and vegetables, and after dinner there was some snacking that included swiss cheese, spicy pepper jelly, and somehow, even freshly baked cookies were made and consumed. All of this “normal evening at home” revelry makes a mess. There are so many little water cups in my sink. The roasting pan might not even be soaking yet. And I wash dishes by hand, so I’m going to have to really get in there and get the job done.\nBut I feel like I’d rather do something else this morning. I feel like I’m called to read my book about walnut trees and drink coffee. Once I’ve had my coffee, I feel like I’m actually called to write my own book about trees (Oh my goodness, can you believe how the walnut flowers form in the spring!), so maybe I am. But really, what I’m actually called to right now is to wash those dishes. So, if I’m longing for a higher calling than that, then I should aim to wash those dishes cheerfully.\nNow there’s a high calling: do the work that is set before you, no matter what it may be, with a cheerful heart. Paul wasn’t joking when he wrote, “Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord” (Colossians 3:23). In other words, we are to do even our most mundane tasks for the Lord. Martin Luther King Jr. famously and beautifully said, “If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, ‘Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well.’”\nWe are called to cheerfully work as unto the Lord, even if we are dealing with drudgery or severe oppression from every standpoint. In this, we experience the highest and most difficult human act, that of humility in all our work and relationships. We also learn how to love the Lord with our entire being—heart, soul, and strength—submitting our will to His in all circumstances (Deuteronomy 6:4–5).\nWhy? Our reward isn’t the applause of men, or the accumulation of riches (even from the hypothetical publication of a thrilling tome on walnut leaves). Our reward and inheritance is from the Lord. We serve Christ, and what an honor that is, to serve the one who knelt and washed the filthy feet of His slow-to-listen, little-in-faith, betraying disciples (John 13:1–17). We are to serve in the same way He bore the cross for us. His humility is our example. He teaches us by example. May we learn “to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with [our] God” (Micah 6:8).",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey T. Hurley\nTalking about Christ can be intimidating for most anyone. I’ve followed Christ for over fifteen years and received my master’s degree from a local seminary—and I am still intimidated about sharing God’s truth with others. When I read Paul’s letters in Scripture, I am amazed at his conviction for sharing truth with people despite difficult circumstances, persecution, and imprisonment. So, how then, does Paul encourage his listeners, and us today, to live a bold life of faith? He writes: “Devote yourselves to prayer; stay alert in it with thanksgiving” (Colossians 4:2). \nPrayer and thanksgiving. They are pillars of our faith, hallmarks of an active faith in the Lord, through which we live as ambassadors for Christ. They may sound like the simplest of disciplines for the Christian life, and yet, we are still often paralyzed by fear to speak assuredly with God and with others. But why?\nWell, for one, we don’t want to get it wrong. We don’t want to be judged harshly. We are afraid to speak truth into each other’s lives and lovingly call out sin if needed. And we don’t want to be too honest with God about our fears. We don’t want to confess to Him that we feel more comfortable remaining silent around our co-workers or family members when the topic of spirituality comes up. I know that for me, these are just some of the reasons I give for my own doubts.\nBut Scripture reassures us that “the LORD is near all who call out to him, all who call out to him with integrity” (Psalm 145:18). When we ask God for help in difficult conversations, He hears us. When we pray about our every concern or worry, He offers “peace that surpasses all understanding” (Philippians 4:7). Fear is replaced by thanksgiving as we allow prayer to transform our posture toward God and others, and we are equipped to tell others about the goodness of the gospel. \nPaul also instructs us in this way: “Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer each person” (Colossians 4:6). Many of our conversations lean on the side of grace—it’s the salty part we have trouble with. In the Old Testament, priests used salt to preserve the offering sacrifice from corruption (Leviticus 2:13). The sacrifice needed to stay clean and holy before it was offered to God. So, when Paul urges us to season our speech with salt, he may be asking us to call out the moral decay we see and help to preserve the holiness in others. Filling our speech with both grace and salt provides us with the ability to edify each person, to build them up toward Jesus, and join the whole body for effective work in God’s kingdom (Ephesians 4:15–16).\nDespite our fears as followers of Jesus, staying devoted in prayer guards our hearts and minds. Staying alert with thanksgiving gives us eyes to see God’s work, despite our flaws and awkward conversations about faith. It’s as if Paul is instructing us to worry less and worship more, as we faithfully step out in faith for the gospel.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Tameshia Williams\nReading Paul’s epistles can make me nostalgic for the days of hand-written letters. A child of the nineties, I’m old enough to remember the time before email and other electronic communications, when snail mail was just mail. The memory doesn’t fade: the sound of my pen scratching against my notepad as an adolescent me inked a letter to a friend or a relative. There was something personal about licking the envelope (even though Mom said to use a sponge) and the gross (but secretly liked) aftertaste, then dropping it off in the mailbox. \nIn addition to writing to the church at Colossae, Paul also sent a letter to his friend, Philemon, who lived in Colossae, on behalf of another friend, Onesimus. Paul penned both letters during his house arrest in Rome. In the opening verses from Philemon, we’re given a picture of who we are to be to one another, and what active involvement in the Church really looks like. We also discover that Philemon was actively involved in the Christian community in Colossae, hosting church gatherings at his house (Philemon 1:2). \nPaul tells us Philemon was a source of “great joy and encouragement” because of his service among the Colossian believers, causing “the hearts of the saints [to be] refreshed through [him]” (v.7). It seems Philemon was more than a friend to Paul—he was a brother in the faith (v.7). \nBecause of the gospel, we, too, are deeply connected to each other; we are a faith family, yet ours is more dynamic than distant relatives who only see each occasionally or even a close-knit family. God intends for us to be fully present in our relationships with the believers in our lives. As our Good Shepherd, He has made provisions for all of our needs, spiritual and natural (Psalm 23:1), and He often uses the members of our Church family to meet our needs, and vice versa. \nDaily, we move toward relationships in love, refreshing hearts when we show up for one another. That can look like contributing our financial resources or sharing a meal. That can look like walking with those experiencing hard seasons of loss and offering comfort. And showing up especially includes forgiveness. As sources of joy and comfort, we support each other in every situation, good or bad, committed to one another’s spiritual growth.\nPhilemon’s love and faith were a testament to the love and sacrifice that Jesus demonstrated through His life and death. The gospel is the foundation and continuing motivation for all our acts of love. God calls every one of us to live out our salvation among His family of believers. Let’s continue to seek the Lord for specific ways in which we can refresh the hearts of the people God has placed in our lives.",

		"devo_summary": "BY Bailey Gillespie\nTo my knowledge, I’ve never had a real enemy. Maybe a couple “frenemies” over the years, after silly quarrels or jealousies, but no one who was really out to get me. But, like most of us, I have crossed paths with a few people who have behaved harmfully toward my friends and family, and these folks are probably the hardest ones to love in the name of Christ. My inner Mama Bear comes out, and I get protective.  \nIn this second half of the book of Philemon, the apostle Paul makes a big ask. He appeals on behalf of Onesimus, the formerly enslaved man and his companion in prison, asking Philemon to welcome him with open arms. The apostle goes as far as to call Onesimus his “very own heart” and offers to take on whatever debt the man happens to owe in order to give him a fresh start (Philemon 12). “Refresh my heart in Christ,” Paul tells Philemon (v.20). It seems that while in prison, God arrested Paul’s heart and taught him what it meant to care for others even—no, especially—when they have done wrong.\nPhilemon is the shortest and most personal of Paul’s letters, but it packs a punch by capturing the heart of the gospel. This letter is an intimate glimpse at what the book of Colossians looks like in practice, when we care for others because of the price Christ paid. In it, we find a beautiful model for the ministry of reconciliation that Christ calls all believers to (2 Corinthians 5:16–17). \nIt’s a ministry of extending forgiveness to those who have wronged us, just like Joseph was asked to do by his father (Genesis 50:17). It’s a ministry of showing compassion to those who may or may not deserve it. It involves considering each other first and foremost as part of our spiritual family, instead of only through the lens of ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or gender (Galatians 3:28). Because we all bear the image of God, we are all invited to have a seat at the table in His household. This is the true gospel. \nWe have work to do, friends! This ministry of reconciliation is the most life-giving thing we could ever participate in. But thankfully, we don’t do it in our own strength. The Spirit of the Lord is what moves our hearts and serves as the bridge between us and those God calls us to seek out and love. \nThank you, Jesus, for reconciling us to you through your life, death, and resurrection. We praise you for being Lord over all creation—over our everyday, breakfast-making lives, and over the universe in all its cosmic complexity. Help us have eyes to see our brothers and sisters as You see them: men and women, image-bearers, and dearly loved children of God. ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 1:1-14, 2 Samuel 7:12-15, John 1:1-5, 2 Corinthians 4:4-6\n\nHave you ever tried to understand something completely new? As a senior in college I enrolled in a sculpture class—while majoring in German. I understand words, but I do not understand shapes. Trying to sculpt a three-dimensional representation of the human head turned out to be the only collegiate task that could reliably make me cry. I could not comprehend how to shape the turn of a lip or the curve of a nose. The rest of the class would talk about differing angles or closing one eye while looking at the model, but it was an impenetrable mystery to me.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews is trying to explain something completely different to an audience of Jewish Christians who were already being persecuted for their faith. Though they were believers, the concept of Jesus as Messiah was something would have been difficult to imagine until about 70 years prior, when Jesus was born. Some knew He was the Savior, although what that meant to them varied and was still largely misunderstood. The author is still trying to introduce us to this nearly incomprehensible concept: the God-Man. Without talking down to the reader, he explains clearly, from the very beginning, the nature of this strange and wonderful person who is both God and man.\n\nIn the first chapter of Hebrews, the writer essentially asks the question, What is the nature of the Son? and what’s more, Why does the nature of the Son matter? \n\nFirst, the Son replaces the prophets and fulfills their prophecies. He is both the radiance of God’s glory and the exact expression of God’s nature. Worthy of all worship, He is superior to the angels and remains the same forever (Hebrews 1:3–11). Indeed, God “has spoken to us by his Son” and “has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him” (vv.1–2). \n\nHow awesome is Christ, the Son! And yet this very Christ, the creator and sustainer of the world, is also the One who purifies us from our sin by His own sacrifice. He speaks directly to us and acts on our behalf—the same God whom all the fiery angels serve! Both the new covenant and the eternal priesthood of Christ are the unfathomable gift of God to a sinful people in need of a Savior.\n\nWithout Christ there is an overwhelming barrier between us and God, between our sinfulness and His holiness. But in Christ we find an even more overwhelming answer. We cannot comprehend the greatness of His glory or the awesomeness of His majesty, yet in Christ we are made daughters and heirs of His kingdom, having been washed clean by His blood.\n\n",

But today’s passage in Hebrews starts with a verse containing the conjunctive adverb, “therefore” (the CSB translates it “for this reason”), so a little grammar ditty may help remind us what exactly a conjunction is and, well, how it functions. \n\nLike a regular conjunction (such as “and” or “but”), a conjunctive adverb connects two words or clauses; however, it also shows the relationship between two ideas. Therefore, the author of Hebrews must be trying to draw a connection for us between two related thoughts. While we can assume the writer didn’t set out to begin the chapter this way (chapters weren’t added to the Bible until the 1200s), we can look back to the preceding chapter to see what the first idea is.\n\nIn chapter 1, the author establishes that Jesus is the Son of God, and that He is superior to the angels in authority, as Creator, and in His role as the author of our salvation. In chapter 2, we read that because Jesus is superior to the angels, believers should hold tight to their belief in Him (v.1). That while He is superior to everything and everyone we could ever imagine, He is also the God who remembers us and cares for us (v.6). \n\nAt the time of this letter, the original audience of Hebrews was in danger of walking away from their faith. They were persecuted, misunderstood, and targeted for their belief in Jesus Christ. And so the author is writing a book-long defense of believing in Jesus, beginning with this one conjunctive adverb: therefore or because.\n\nBecause Jesus is superior to the angels…\nBecause His gospel is better than the Law given to Moses…\nBecause Jesus is co-equal with God, but also because He became fully man…\nBecause of His signs and wonders and miracles…\nBecause everything is subjected under His feet…\nBecause of His suffering and death—\nListen! Don’t drift away. \n\nThe temptation to drift away was not just a concern for this audience of Jewish Christians; it is real for all of us, all of the time. From the ancient believers who found themselves facing death or being treated as outcasts because of their faith, to modern-day believers like us who struggle to believe for a myriad reasons, this passage in Hebrews reminds us that our faith is anchored in the person and work of Jesus. \n\nAll of Hebrews sings this song: Jesus is who He said He was, and He is who God promised He would be. Therefore, we believe.\n\n",

We’d just made an offer on the place and were giving my husband’s family a tour when his grandpa (affectionately known to us as Papaw) said, “I remember when I built this house.” \n\nWe bumped into each other at the base of our oak staircase banister as if someone had just pulled an invisible emergency break, bringing the tour to an abrupt stop.\n\n“You built this house?” we asked, astounded. \n\nOur home was built long before either of us was born. Papaw was a much younger man then, running his own contractor business. We’d picked out our house online and made an offer on the spot without even considering who had laid the foundation so many years before. The idea that we had chosen a home carefully constructed by a man who chose to love us was a precious dose of unexpected grace.  \n\nPapaw is gone now and we are blessed to remember him every time we run our hands down the banister he installed, shuffle our socked feet across the hardwood floors he laid, or gaze out the large picture window he set into place. Our house is more sacred to us because of whose hands swung the hammer that put it together. \n\nIn today’s passages, the writer of Hebrews is asking his readers to lift their eyes off of Moses and onto the Greater One. We might not fixate so much on the greatness of Moses these days, but we do tend to treasure the wrong prize. A cosmic shift occurs in our souls when we acknowledge that everything we love and treasure ultimately belongs to God. It all matters because He matters so much. “Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God” (Hebrews 3:4). \n\nThis circles back and underscores a thought from the second chapter of Hebrews. We find it sandwiched between two commas, yet it deserves its own exclamation point: “For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, is bringing so many sons to glory…” (v.10). \n\nWe hear it in the words of Colossians 1: “For everything was created by him, in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through him and for him” (v.16). \n\nAnd we see it again in the first chapter of John’s Gospel. It reads: “All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created” (v.3). \n\nIt’s tempting to think we’re the ones buildings something here: We’re building a family. We’re building a career. We’re building a home. But all of these things are God’s handiwork; they are already His. He crafted it long ago—every beam, every person, every bloom. \n\nJust like the Hebrews, we tend to elevate the message over the Messiah, the prophet over the High Priest, the creation above the Creator. But Scripture pulls an invisible emergency break on this tour of our pride. How much better it is to trust in the Builder than in the building (Hebrews 2:13). Our lives become more precious and our hands more open when we acknowledge that it’s all His—made by Him and for Him, and given to us to enjoy as His beloved children. \n\n",

		"devo_title": "Warning Against Unbelief",
		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 3:7-19, John 3:16-21, Romans 11:1-6\n\nHands down, my favorite day of the year during elementary school was field day. On field day, each class wore matching t-shirts and competed in outdoor events like the 100-yard dash, Red Rover, and the ultimate team challenge: tug-of-war.\n\nI always felt a rush of nerves as my class stepped up to the rope to compete against the other classes in our grade. I was tall and lanky, not the strongest kid, but I knew none of that mattered in tug-of-war, because it took everyone’s strength to win, not just mine. And when I got tired, I could loosen my grip knowing my classmates would pick up the slack.\n\nOur passage today points to this type of teamwork—not in the context of field day, of course, but in the context of faith and the community effort it so often requires.\n\nWe can assume some individuals from the community addressed in Hebrews had been loosening their grip on their faith, swaying toward unbelief, the type of unbelief that leads to rebellion against God. The writer warns, “Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Hebrews 3:12).\n\nAs God’s people, we have a long history of this type of unbelief. From the Israelites wandering in the desert, to the early church addressed here in Hebrews, to Christians today—our tendency is to believe in ourselves and our own way over God and His. Fortunately, the writer of Hebrews provides a strategy to guard ourselves against unbelief: \n\n“But encourage each other daily, while it is still called today,\nso that none of you is hardened by sin’s deception” (v.13).\nIn other words, if you want to stay away from unbelief, stay together.\n\nThe more I walk this road of faith, the more I realize how corporate the practice of faith must be if we are going to maintain it. The very nature of our faith is communal. We serve a triune God who from the beginning has been committed to communing with us. So much so, that He came to be with us in human form through the person of Jesus Christ, who then died so that we might commune with God for eternity.\n\nWe are not meant to believe alone. I think this is why the writer of Hebrews so earnestly warns against unbelief, and then in the same breath reminds us to encourage one another. When I am on the brink of unbelief, it is always community that pulls me back to the truth of the gospel. If I’d had to face the other team alone, I surely would have abandoned the rope long ago. But knowing I have others there who have strength when I don’t has provided the encouragement I’ve needed to stay in the game.  \n\nThis is why I find this passage so hopeful. Just as much as it is a warning against unbelief, it is also a reminder that we don’t have to go up against unbelief alone. Because our Messiah is our companion, we have companionship with each other.\n\n",

		"devo_title": "The Promised Rest",
		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Ellen Taylor\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:1-13, Psalm 95:7-11, 1 Peter 1:3-5\n\nThe promised rest.\n\nIn today’s busy culture, especially in the United States, that phrase seems too good to be true. I tend to crave rest in different ways, depending on the season I’m in. When I was in college, running myself ragged, I would have given anything for a quick cat nap during the day, but now I just long for a solid eight hours of sleep at night. \n\nThe kind of rest described in Hebrews chapter 4 is not the nap our bodies beg for after a busy day. God invited the Israelites into His rest, into the Sabbath, when they were wandering in the wilderness. However, they rebelled and did not enter into His rest because of their disobedient, discontented hearts. We are offered this same rest; it is promised to us because of Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. But the full Sabbath, the truest rest promised to us by God, will not occur until we are face to face with our Maker in eternity. \n\nIn the meantime, of course, God gives us a Sabbath each week—a day to rest, reconnect with God, and recenter our lives around Him. But if I’m honest, a real Sabbath feels unattainable to me today. Maybe the busyness our culture has come to call “normal” speaks to our true priorities. Or maybe we’re just looking at the Sabbath through the wrong lens. \n\nWhat if practicing the Sabbath includes sinking our teeth into the things that provide us with a taste of heaven? What if it’s savoring the morning light as it streams through our curtains, or relishing the feeling of propping our feet up on the coffee table after a long day of work? What if rest comes in cherishing moments of laughter and tears with the people around us who pull us closer to Jesus? What if we were to breathe all of this in as it happens, thanking God for these things in the moment, with the knowledge that our ultimate rest—our eternal salvation—is secure in Christ?\n\nThe true rest we long for will not fully come this side of heaven. The author of Hebrews tells us “a Sabbath rest remains for God’s people” (4:9). He encourages us to “make every effort to enter that rest” (v.11). The price has already been paid by Jesus. The “effort” we now make is to remain in Him as He remains in us (John 15:4). So we continue the work He’s given us to do, living in the tension that the kingdom of God is here and now, but also still to come and greater than we can imagine. We keep leaning in to God for strength as He builds His kingdom through us. And we find Sabbath rest where we are, in the presence of God Most High.\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Melanie Rainer\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 4:14-16, Hebrews 5:1-10, Psalm 110:1-7, Matthew 4:1-11\n\nI used to think I had to sacrifice a lot of things in order for God to love me. \n\nI have this vivid memory from my high school youth group. At one particular meeting, we listened to one of the “stars” of our youth group give a testimony about how he believed God was calling him to quit baseball and give all his time and energy to God. So he quit. His choice to make a big sacrifice was glorified and applauded. And I wondered, What is God calling me to sacrifice? What do I have to give up for Him to love me? What would be enough?\n\nOof.\n\nIt took me years to identify how traumatic that message was for me. Though I don’t aim to judge one person’s actions and how they follow the promptings of the Spirit, the glamorization of that choice was embedded in my mind. I lived in fear that if I didn’t sacrifice the things I loved to do or wear or make or buy, then I wasn’t doing enough for God. I thought He would punish me instead.\n\nAnd so I walked around afraid that God was going to take everything and everyone I loved away from me. I began to see my relationship with Him as a give-and-take where He only took, and I only gave. I didn’t know that is literally the opposite of what the Bible tells us.\n\nI didn’t understand that what I owe to God is more than I could ever give. I didn’t understand that “sacrificing” wouldn’t make me a better Christian. In fact, it wouldn’t make me a Christian at all. I didn’t understand that the debt I owe to God is because of my sin, and that Jesus is the only One who could pay it. Without Jesus, I was—and I am—helpless to stand before God.\n\nThe truth is God does require something for the payment of our sins, because His is a perfect justice. But thankfully, the balance of His mercy does not rest on me. It rests solely on Jesus, who “became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him” (Hebrews 5:9).\n\nThe closing verse of Edward Mote’s classic hymn, “My Hope is Built on Nothing Less,” says: Oh, may I then in Him be found, / dressed in His righteousness alone, / faultless to stand before the throne. Today’s passage from Hebrews beckons us to do the same, to “approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need” (Hebrews 4:16).\n\nBoldness. Some translations say “with confidence,” which we have only in the security of Christ. We don’t have to approach the throne with fear, with everything we love bundled up to lay on an altar, thinking that what we have to offer is somehow going to be enough to pay for our sin—because it isn’t.\n\nOnly Jesus is enough.\n\nJesus is our Great High Priest (v.14). Traditionally, high priests would offer sacrifices to atone for the sins of the people and themselves, because they sinned too. But Jesus’s sinless perfection made His sacrifice the source of eternal salvation for everyone who would ever believe.\n\nThis is an eternal, unchanging truth: We are not enough. Only Christ’s righteousness allows us to approach God’s throne with confidence, to receive the grace and mercy He offers us.\n\nThanks be to God!\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Rebecca Faires\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 5:11-14, Hebrews 6:1-12, Philippians 3:12-16, 1 Peter 2:1-3\n\nI feel like I’m a great gal. I go to church (but only when all five of my kids aren’t sick). I read my Bible (unless I am very tired or very busy or extremely lazy). I pray (especially when I have lost my glasses). And I write about Scripture (because it’s my dream job and people pay me to do it). \n\nOkay, so I’m a great gal with some mixed motives. But here’s the trouble: It’s actually pretty possible to look like a believer, enjoy the fellowship of believers, and even do a lot of the right things externally, but still not touch the heart of the matter. It’s possible to do all of these things without maturing in the faith and truly knowing God. \n\nAll of these good works may make me think I’m a great gal. They can certainly look like the fruit of the gospel at work in my life. But Scripture tells us our works are dead when we depend on them for our salvation (Romans 3:27–4:5). The author of Hebrews is warning us to stop focusing on such “elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity” (Hebrews 6:1).\n\nNo matter how many orphanages you visit in Haiti, you cannot save yourself. No matter how many women you rescue out of slavery, you cannot rescue yourself. Christ alone saves us. His desire is that we grow in maturity by the Holy Spirit, working out our faith to full assurance, which is only found in Christ (v.11).\n\nIf we are keeping lists of our own merits, even if just in our heads and hearts, it is a real danger. We cannot work our way to righteousness. But the temptation to rely on our own merits is powerful. The Church is warned about this in no uncertain terms. If we seek after good works more than we desire Christ, we are in grave danger. Beware, lest we fall away and come short of salvation! Only Christ is sufficient to save.\n\nYet “God is not unjust; he will not forget [our] work and the love [we] demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them” (v.10). When we look to Christ for our salvation, our humble doings flow from gratitude to the One who saves us. We love others because we imitate the One who is love (1 John 4:8). We serve because He is the servant of all. Our good works don’t earn our salvation; they are the result of our salvation, fruit born of the Holy Spirit at work in us (Galatians 5:22–23).\n\nLet us look beyond the work of our own hands and instead place our hope in Christ’s finished work on the cross. May we hear His call to daily repentance and obedience. And may our works flow out of total thankfulness to God, our Creator and Redeemer.\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 6:13-20, Hebrews 7:1-10, Genesis 22:15-18, Romans 8:28-30\n\nI discovered my first gray hair this week. Being in my mid-twenties, I’ve always believed this event would unfold naturally and gracefully decades from now, like a badge of honor for a seasoned and experienced woman. It did not happen that way. However, as I sifted through my dark brown strands to find the one that wasn’t, I couldn’t help but think of my grandmother. I’ve never gotten through a conversation with someone who knew Polly without mention of her rare poise, cheeks full of laughter, and of course, her beautiful silver hair.\n\nThere are some things I inherited right away from my grandmother, like the pearl earrings she’d received on a special anniversary and the cooking tools that still smelled like her house. I inherited her love for music, the same knack for penmanship, and a preference for extra-sour lemonade. And then there are things I didn’t know I’d get from Polly, even after she was gone—things like her fountain pen, which my aunt gave me because I became a writer, and the aforementioned early appearance of gray hairs.\n\nThere’s something about an inheritance that roots you in a sense of belonging. Or in some cases, you find out there’s been a place for you all along. In Hebrews 6, we find that our inheritance is both current and eternal. It is everything we need, exactly what we’d hoped, and all we never thought to ask for.\n\nI love how thorough God is in His promises. It’s as if He takes joy in watching His children read His Word and learn His Will, savoring each gift along the way. Two big themes in the book of Hebrews are revelation and redemption, and God’s covenant with His people is what bridges the two.\n\n“Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us” (Hebrews 6:17–18). Notice the two unchangeable things here: God’s promise and God’s oath. He wants to make doubly sure we know that our inheritance in Him is true.\n\nMaybe we don’t realize our inheritance through the way we age or through hand-me-downs in the cupboard, but just like He did for Abraham, God makes sure we know we’ve obtained the promise. He is the only One who can give us the sweetest inheritance of all: Himself. “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure” (Hebrews 6:19). May we continue to hold fast to Him, our hope and our prize. Amen.\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Erin Davis\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 7:11-28, Genesis 14:18-20, 1 John 2:1\n\nI am raising four boys on a farm full of mud. \n\nThrough much threatening, cajoling, scrubbing and—okay, I’ll admit it—bribing, I can occasionally get everyone clean. But there isn’t enough soap and water in the universe to ensure that they will stay clean. Most often, we don’t even make it to the car before someone (or everyone) becomes more soiled than spiffed up. \n\nThe Levitical priests could surely more than feel my pain. Once a year they would go to great lengths to ask the Lord to clean out the record of sin accumulated by His people. After extensive preparations, a priest would enter the most holy place inside the veil to present a sin offering (Leviticus 16:2–34). Verse 30 tells us: “Atonement will be made for you on this day to cleanse you, and you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD.” And so when the priest exited, God’s people were clean. It was a holy scrubbing, but never a permanent one. \n\nYear after year, the priests would enter the tabernacle to atone for the people’s sins, only to return again a year later. This was not an exercise in futility, but God’s provisional means of covering their sin. It was also an object lesson for generations to come, teaching them that nothing we could ever do—no matter how meticulously planned and executed—to make these “filthy rags” clean. We can scrub and scrub and scrub and the muck of sin will stick to us, making it impossible for us to be in the presence of our holy, holy, holy God (Revelation 4:8).  \n\nSo we keep scouring, don’t we? Until our hearts and souls feel raw from the effort. We need the reminder that we cannot obtain perfection through human striving. God’s law doesn’t polish us up to a high shine; instead, it exposes every gritty imperfection (v.19). \n\nThe priests couldn’t keep us clean because they were stained by sin too. We’ve always been the blind leading the blind, the stained scrubbing the stained. We needed someone untarnished by sin to enter the Holy Place on our behalf. “For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v.26). Christ is the true high priest, and His is the superior priesthood. He is the only permanent solution to our sin problem. His blood alone, shed on the cross, has the power to truly cleanse us. \n\nThe lyrics of Elisha A. Hoffman’s old gospel hymn, “Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb,” sum it up well:\n\nHave you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?…\nAre your garments spotless?\nAre they white as snow?\nAre you washed in the blood of the Lamb?\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is an invitation to stop our scrubbing and to bathe in the deluge of grace that flows from the cross. Our perfect Savior made a way for us to be cleansed—permanently. May we fully trust in His grace this hour, and the next, and all the ones to follow.\n\n",

To get there, we traveled to a remote location in central China on a bus that swayed along treacherous roads. I refused to look out the window for the majority of the drive because I was certain my gaze would draw us down to the canyon below. But soon enough a series of brown tapered roofs came into focus, hanging from the side of the mountain like an ancient rock climber with a strong grip. \n\nTo this day, Xuan Kong Monastery—also known as “the Hanging Monastery”—is one of the most interesting places of religious worship I’ve ever visited. Built 1,400 years ago, the walls and floors creaked with every step. My sense of awe may have actually been fear as I walked the narrow hallways, worried that at any moment the whole thing might crumble to the ground.\n\nNot too long ago, I read through a She Reads Truth study called See the Lord’s Salvation: A Lenten Study of Exodus, where I studied the God-given plans for another remarkable place of worship, one designed to honor God and built by His chosen people, the Israelites. (Go back to this study of Exodus to see the deep and intricate meaning of each detail in those plans.) But no matter how beautiful the tabernacle might have been, it was a human creation, a copy and a shadow of what was in heaven (Hebrews 8:5). Just like the Hanging Monastery in China, the tabernacle was fragile.\n\nOur churches and pastors and priests today are weak too. The walls creak. The leaders fail. Sometimes it feels like the sanctuaries do nothing more than remind us of our need. If that’s all they do, I’m okay with that. I need a better priest than the best on earth. I need a better temple.\n\nHere’s what’s amazing. “The true tabernacle set up by the Lord” (v.2) isn’t a destination with walls and nails. It is a communion we have with God in our hearts. For we are God’s temple and the Spirit of God lives in us (1 Corinthians 3:16–17). And Jesus, our High Priest and Good Shepherd, “is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises” (Hebrews 8:6). \n\nJesus is the kind of priest we need in a better sanctuary than we could ever build. He takes us with all our heartsickness, sin, and need, and gives us access to the Father. In that secret room, the one in our spirit, our Father waits, ready to meet with us. \n\n",

It’s hard to imagine things will ever look much different than this, what’s right in front of us today. \n\nI doubt that even the most imaginative Israelites in Egypt could have fathomed their miraculous escape from slavery across the dry ocean floor (Exodus 13:17–14:31). The disciples huddled together in Jerusalem could not have foreseen the power of Pentecost, even in their wildest dreams. I mean, tongues of fire? Crazy! (Acts 2:3). And when we were slaves to our sin, we could not have comprehend being truly free (Romans 6:17; John 8:36). It seems our God is always moving us toward something better, something brighter—something more than we dare to ask, imagine, or hope for (Ephesians 3:20). \n\nThose who worshiped under the Old Testament covenant surely could not have grasped all that Jesus would usher in. That a day would dawn when sacrifices of animal blood were no longer required because Christ’s blood was sufficient to atone once and for all. That God’s presence wouldn’t rest between the angel’s wings on the ark of the covenant (Exodus 25:17–22), but would move freely in our hearts. That a time was coming when the law would not be written on slabs of stone, but instead on the hearts and minds of God’s beloved children (Jeremiah 31:33). That the curtain of the tabernacle would be torn in two, making a way for sinners to enter the presence of God (Matthew 27:51). \n\nYet, here we are, “speaking of a new covenant, [by which] he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away” (Hebrews 8:13). Today, we are the recipients of the avalanche of grace Moses could only dream of. We are free in a way even the Israelites who fled Egypt never knew. Under the new covenant, we have been saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. This is a gift from God by which all our wrongdoing is forgiven, our sins never to be remembered again (Ephesians 2:8–9; Hebrews 8:12).\n\nThe old is gone and the new, superior covenant of grace is better than our wildest hopes. But we are also broken people, still stuck in this broken world and so easily convinced that this is all there is. Yet God is moving us onward, toward something unthinkably good. All that we see is ready to vanish away because our God is making all things new (Revelation 21:1–5).\n\nMaybe you can’t quite picture it. Perhaps your heart doesn’t dare believe it, but that won’t stop the Lord from delivering it. The best is truly yet to come.\n\n",

It’s hard for me to remember that I have access to Him through the Holy Spirit at all times. It’s hard for me to remember that even when I don’t have the words to speak, He still listens.\n\nUnder the old covenant described in the first part of Hebrews 9, God’s people were unable to communicate with Him directly. While the priests could enter into the first room of the tabernacle to perform their ministry of sacrifices, God’s presence was contained inside the holy of holies of the tabernacle, a place only the high priest could enter but once a year, and only then to provide a sacrifice for himself and God’s people to cover the sins they had committed. \n\nThe author of Hebrews consistently uses Old Testament references and stories to tell his readers about the better hope they have in Christ. In referencing the old covenant, which they were undoubtedly familiar with, the author is reminding them of the freedom they now have in Christ—freedom to acknowledge God’s nearness and drink in His presence. Christ took the place of the high priest, entering into the most holy place, sacrificing Himself, and cleansing us with His blood (Hebrews 9:11–14). \n\n“[Christ] is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, because a death has taken place for redemption from the transgressions committed under the first covenant” (v.15).\n\nChrist is the Great High Priest, and because of His sacrifice on the cross, God is ever-present with us. We don’t have to rely on a human high priest to go before God on our behalf; Christ does that for us. He looks at us and says that we are His children, His people—that nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8:38).\n\nIt’s not always easy to remember that we have instant access to our Father. In situations where we don’t know what to say or pray or do, we feel alone. We forget He is already near to us—nearer than our very breath. But reminders of this new covenant ministry, a ministry we are now an active part of, keep us grounded in the knowledge that God is with us and for us. Always.\n\n",

Certainly peace for me, and possibly some kind of peace for the one I forgive.\n\nOur forgiveness is vitally important, but there is a greater forgiveness that changes everything. Our forgiveness doesn’t actually yield eternal pardon for the offender, and that’s why it doesn’t cost us much. But in order to actually pay for one transgression of God’s law, someone has to literally die. That’s the deal. The wages of sin is actual death (Romans 6:23). A sacrifice must be made. But the sacrifice has to be totally without sin, so none of us can just valiantly die for our own sins. We need a sinless sacrifice. \n\nOur forgiveness is only possible because Christ is that sinless sacrifice. \n\nNow, because sin has been paid for, we have life and joy abundantly. By sacrificing Himself, He has removed our sins (Hebrews 9:26). When Christ comes again, He will come bringing the fulfillment of our salvation: everlasting life in glory.\n\nThis passage in Hebrews 9 seems to be about establishing the justice and legality of what Christ did. It is delivered in covenantal and transactional terms. Why? It is important to know that what Christ did, He did rightly. He didn’t cut corners, or sweep sin under the rug. He dealt with it fully, fairly, finally. Because of this, we can have great assurance and security in Christ. When Satan attempts to undermine our faith with doubt, we can lean on our righteousness of Christ. His payment for sin is fully sufficient. His grace is greater than all our sin, and nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews further his point with a comparison. The first covenant was also inaugurated with blood (v.18). But all the blood of bulls and goats could not fully satisfy the demands of justice. The blood of animals was sprinkled on the earthly tabernacle and its furnishings. But the blood of Christ, the only perfect and sufficient sacrifice, has purified even the heavenly things (v.23). His payment for our sin has paid our debt from the depths of earth to the heights of heaven.\n\nForgiveness requires the shedding of blood. And Christ’s blood has been shed for us. \n\nWhat then can man do to us? What can Satan say to topple such a salvation? Thanks be to God, we are secure in Christ. When Christ returns, we are told, He will come, not to pay a further debt (all our sins have been paid for!), but to bring salvation (v.28). Praise the Lord!\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:1-18, Psalm 40:1-17, 1 Peter 2:24\n\nTwice, my girlfriends have talked me into running a half marathon. And twice, my knees have revolted. Both times I hobbled across that finish line, I was so ready to be done. But can you imagine if I had decided to just keep running? I surely cannot. Yet, oftentimes in our spiritual lives we keep running a race that’s already been won. We keep thinking that if we just jog another lap, add on a few more miles, somehow we will be more qualified.\n\nThe thing is, Jesus ran the perfect race and won the final victory for us. With the sacrifice of His life He proclaimed, “It is finished” (John 19:28–30). So why don’t we accept the gift of grace? And if we have accepted it, why don’t we choose to live into it?\n\nGrace can be difficult to accept. While we all want forgiveness and unconditional love, the world has taught us that forgiveness is not easily won and love always comes with limits. It can be hard to live in the reality of God, in the truth of the gospel. We might picture our heavenly Father like an earthly one, disappointed or angry or withholding. We might think He judges us with a harsh eye. But God’s love is like nothing in this world, and until we open our hearts to His grace we will keep on needlessly trying to prove ourselves.\n\nUnlike the priests who had to daily return to their work, when Jesus offered His sufficient “sacrifice for sins forever, [He] sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). He sat down. This symbolized completeness and finality. He didn’t pace around. He didn’t wring His hands. He didn’t find more busywork to do. He sat down at the right hand of His Father.\n\nChrist’s sacrifice is complete. It was also made “once for all time” (Hebrews 10:10), which means the gospel is always fresh. And because our hearts so easily forget this news that seems too good to be true, we need to be reminded again and again: every morning when we step out of bed, weary from a world we’ve barely woken to, every time we stumble and fall, and every time we believe the lie that we need to somehow earn the love of God. The repeated sacrifices of the old covenant can now be replaced with repeated proclamations of the gospel to ourselves and to our brothers and sisters.\n\nMaybe God is inviting you to sit down at His feet today—to just be with Him. To soak yourself in Christ’s finished work for you. You are saved, not by your own will or work, but by the perfect blood of Jesus. Rest easy in the presence of your Redeemer.\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Andrea Lucado\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 10:19-39, Deuteronomy 32:35-36, Matthew 27:50-54\n\nThe universal law of cause and effect says that for every effect there is a cause, and likewise, for every cause there is an effect. Why am I giving you a refresher course in seventh-grade natural science? Because applying this law to our passage today is crucial in understanding hope in light of Christ’s faithfulness to us.\n\nHebrews 10:23 says, “Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful.” With “since” being the key word, we can determine that the law of cause and effect applied to this verse would go something like this:\n\nCause: He who promised is faithful.\n\nEffect: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nWhat if we changed the placement of the word “since” to read, “Since we hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, he who promised is faithful”? It would entirely change our cause and effect, right?\n\nCause: We hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering.\n\nEffect: He who promised is faithful.\n\nIn the first set of cause-and-effect statements, we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful to us. In the second, Christ is faithful to us because we hold on to hope.\n\nIf Christ’s faithfulness to me is contingent upon my hope, I’m in big trouble. My hope is not consistent. It varies from day to day, depending upon my circumstances, the weather, or how much coffee I’ve had. My hope can be high one hour and plummet the next.\n\nFortunately, Hebrews does not say we hold on to hope because we are a people who are so very good at hoping. It says we hold on to hope because Christ has been faithful. As the verses leading up to this one emphasize, “since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus… and since we have a great high priest over the house of God… let us draw near… Let us hold on to the confession of our hope” (Hebrews 10:19,21–23).\n\nThe blood of Jesus, our Great High Priest, His faithfulness—this is why we hold on to hope.\n\nIt has taken me a long time to grasp this idea that living a life of faith is so much more about God’s faithfulness to me than it is my faithfulness to Him. To be honest, I still don’t think I completely get it. If I did, I would have far less anxiety, I would sin far less, and I would have much more hope. I need this reminder as much as the early Church did. When I feel hopeless, I need to repeat the cause again and again:\n\nSince He…\nSince He…\nSince He…\n\nHave hope today—not in your ability to hold onto hope, but in Christ’s faithfulness to you. It does not waver. It is the same day in and day out—yesterday, today, and forever. When we rely on His faithfulness alone, our posture toward life will be one of hope and not fear, of trust and not turning away. As the writer said, “We are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and obtain life” (v.39).\n\n",

		"devo_title": "Living by Faith",
		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Claire Gibson\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:1-16, Psalm 33:6-7, John 1:9-13\n\nI recently read a novel by Min Jin Lee called Pachinko. Set in WWII, the story follows an immigrant Korean family that lives in Japan for four generations. The book chronicles their bold acts of faith, fortitude, and survival in the midst of oppression and racial prejudice. I won’t spoil the ending here, but rest assured the ending isn’t what makes the book worth reading. It’s the beginning, middle, and end, all woven together like a symphony. I’ve bought multiple copies, handing them out like candy.\n\nLikewise, the author of Hebrews recounts a family history. Our family history. Each tale is a marriage of belief and action—basically, faith and verbs. \n\nBy faith Abel offered.\nBy faith Noah built.\nBy faith Abraham obeyed and went.\nBy faith Sarah received.\n\nIt’s important to take a moment to really consider what those verbs cost our ancestors. Though Abel’s gift was accepted by God, he was still violently murdered by his brother. Though the ark provided rescue to Noah, he still suffered years of ridicule from his neighbors. Though God kept His promises to Abraham, Abraham still had to walk away from everything he knew and follow God into the desert. As the author of Hebrews says:\n\n“These all died in faith, without having received the promises, but they saw them from a distance, greeted them, and confessed that they were foreigners and temporary residents on earth. Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland” (Hebrews 11:13–14).\n\nI think the reason I like Pachinko so much is that it introduces a family seeking a homeland, experiencing rejection in the place where they live. As a Christian, I seek to embrace that same humbleness, embracing the truth that I am a temporary resident here on earth. This is not my final home. For that reason, I can sacrifice it all, including the comfort of home, if that is what God calls me to do. \n\nThese passages prompt me to ask myself: What are the verbs that God is asking me to act out in my life? Can I boldly trust that He will use those actions for His glory, no matter the cost? No matter the ending?\n\nOne thing is certain: God never spoils an ending. And He makes promises I can hold on to while I walk through the middle. I am chosen and never forsaken. God will go with me—He always arrives to the scene first, and acts as my rearguard. God promises He will complete the good work He started in me (Philippians 1:6). He promises that nothing will be wasted, but all things will be restored (Revelation 21:4–5). While I take these steps, any tears I shed will be like liquid words and God promises to read and store them all (Psalm 56:8).\n\nBut this is about more than just me and you. The author of Hebrews says that acts of faith make non-believers turn and watch. In other words, when we put our our faith into action, we create living proof to a dying world that God exists. Our “faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (Hebrews 11:1).\n\nThat is no small thing.\n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitlin Wernet\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 11:17-40, Luke 13:34-35, James 1:2-4\n\nIt was my cab driver in Boston who lead me to the best cannolis I’ve ever had. “Skip the main bakery location downtown,” he suggested. “Walk a few blocks north and you’ll find the exact same thing without the wait.”\n\nIt was a shop owner in Austin who recommended I visit what I now refer to as “my most favorite bookstore of all time.” You could say I liked it, alright.\n\nIt was my friend in Chicago who knew precisely which building had the best views of the city skyline, and could tell me the history behind every structure and monument in sight.\n\nAnd if you visited my city, Nashville, I’d show you the live music venue with a back alley, so you can enter with the locals and avoid the throes of tourists. Oh, and I’d probably already have put in a request for your favorite song to make sure you sing karaoke before the night is over.\n\nRegardless of where you’re going, everyone knows the best way to find the best tips: ask the locals. Your server at dinner will have more insight than any guidebook you read on the plane, and the friend you’re staying with is guaranteed to keep you from going to the restaurants that didn’t live up to their online reviews.\n\nBut when it comes to faith, it’s even more important to have a guide. And when it comes to struggle or not knowing where to turn, the best thing to have on your side is someone who’s been through it before you. And that’s exactly what we’re given in Hebrews 11: examples of people who have lived by faith. “Faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen” (v.1), and yet, God is gracious enough to fill our eyes with hopeful images of our brothers and sisters who have successfully lived by the words He has promised.\n\nWe’re reminded of Abel’s sacrifice, Enoch’s protection, Noah’s motivation, Abraham’s obedience, Sarah’s conception, Isaac’s birth, Jacob’s worship, and Moses’s suffering—“all these were approved through their faith” (v. 39). But we’re given these examples not because we’re supposed to be more like each of these human men and women, but because they, too, were afraid. They, too, were unsure and doubtful and wondering if the things they were putting their trust in were actually real. They, too, hoped their faith was more than just wishful thinking.\n\nInside God’s Word, we get to learn from the locals, those who have gone before us and have seen the goodness and truth of our God in all things. But even better, we see time and time again that their go-to move isn’t to look to their own flesh for answers—it’s to ask their Creator. Their stories invite us to do the same, joining a long, tried-and-true legacy of faith.\n\nThe stories of God’s people point us to His face. May they continue to do so, and may our own stories be marked by faith as well. \n\n",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nBy Kaitie Stoddard\n\nScripture Reading: Hebrews 12:1-13, Romans 12:18-21, 1 Timothy 2:5-6\n\nJesus invited His followers to take up their crosses and follow Him. From the outset of His ministry, He wanted us to know that the Christian life is not free from struggle. The writer of Hebrews encourages believers to “strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees” (Hebrews 12:12). Tired hands and weakened knees are not the result of a life on cruise control; they are the result of labor, opposition, and striving.\n\nSome of us may be all too familiar with this reality. Through trial and tribulation, we’ve become well aware that the way of Jesus isn’t always the smoothest path. Still, in times of plenty there is a tendency to brush over the hardships of faith and tough teachings of Scripture. In a comfortable season of life, we might be tempted to believe that our work as a “good Christian” means that God will bless everything we put our hands to. We can forget that walking in the way of Jesus is not without suffering and that, in Jesus, even our suffering has a redemptive purpose. \n\nListen to this encouragement from Hebrews 12:\n\n“Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? … Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live? For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness. No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (vv.7-11).\n\nScripture is clear: God uses everything—struggle and hardship included—for the believer’s good (Romans 8:28). When we assume our way should be easy easy, we forget that Jesus promised the opposite (John 16:33). When we see all pain as a problem to avoid, we miss the opportunity to “rejoice in our afflictions, because we know that affliction produces endurance, endurance produces proven character, and proven character produces hope” (Romans 5:3–4). We miss the opportunity to become more like Christ.\n\nIt’s tempting to go through our places of struggle alone, not wanting God or anyone else to see us at a low point. But when we recognize dark days as an expected part of a life of faith, we can look to the One who has walked this road before. Jesus, our victor and champion, suffered betrayal, persecution, and excruciating death. A “man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:3), He understands our pain. And He is with us through every hardship when we trust in Him. \n\nWhen your time of suffering comes, look to Jesus. \n\n",

But it’s not really a case of not actually knowing what you had, is it? It’s more a matter of not appreciating that thing, that someone, that blessing—until it’s no longer yours. Maybe you never appreciated it because you never imagined a world in which you’d have to live without it.\n\nSuch is the case with Esau and the oh-so unwise forfeiting of his birthright to his twin brother for the immediate comfort of a home-cooked meal. Whether he truly “despised” his birthright or was merely indifferent to it, Esau did not place great enough importance on his blessing as Isaac’s firstborn son—the blessing that promised both divine protection and authority over other nations (Genesis 25:27–34; 27:29).\n\nWhile the Christians the writer of Hebrews was addressing weren’t merely fighting off hunger pangs, in the face of severe persecution they were tempted to forego their faith in Christ, exchanging the promises of the new covenant for the supposed comfort and familiarity of the old covenant. And so the writer of the book of Hebrews reminds the readers of what’s at stake, comparing the Israelites’ relationship to God at Mt. Sinai under the old covenant of the law (Exodus 19), with the blessings of salvation in Jesus Christ under the new covenant. \n\nThe comparison is a stark one. Their encounter with God at Mt. Sinai left the Israelites, and even Moses, shaken to the core (Hebrews 12:18–21). But that’s not the case for the Hebrew Christians, or for anyone whose faith is in Jesus Christ. \n\n“Instead, [we] have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God… to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written in heaven, to a Judge, who is God of all… and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant…” (vv.22–24).\n\nThe old covenant instilled a holy fear in the hearts of God’s people, putting a safe distance between them and God’s holiness. But the new covenant has torn away the veil separating us from God. Christ, our perfect Mediator and Judge (1 Timothy 2:5; 2 Timothy 4:8), put on skin and came down to endure the judgment of our sin. He eliminated the distance between God and His people, bringing us squarely into right and redeemed relationship with Him. “Our God is a consuming fire,” and His sacrificial love for us should should incite awe and reverence in our hearts, not indifference (Hebrews 12:29). \n\nTo know Christ is to be wrapped up in His grace—a hard-won grace that cost us nothing but did not come cheaply. It cost Jesus His life, the agony of bearing the weight of sin for all of humanity for all time and, for the first and only time in history, separation from the Father (Matthew 27:46). The writer of Hebrews is warning readers, cautioning us to not become hardened by persecution or indifferent to Jesus’s sacrifice, to the grace and salvation that can only be found in Him. “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful” (Hebrews 12:28).\n\n",

The root of all godly living is the person of Christ. He is both our hope and our source of righteousness.\n\nAt the close of the this book, the author recommends a handful of what Matthew Henry calls “excellent duties”: show love and hospitality, care for the mistreated, honor marriage, eschew the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. This final exhortation to contentment certainly loosens the reins and makes the other excellent duties easier. If one is content, the love of money can’t tempt and the shine of someone prettier or younger doesn’t lure.\n\nHave you ever known someone who is truly content? The author of Hebrews points us first and foremost to the example of Christ. But we are also encouraged to watch the fruit of other leaders and, if that fruit is good, imitate their faith. \n\nThe most contented person I know is Nell. You probably don’t know her; she’s not famous. I met her in college, but she wasn’t the first friend I made. She was quiet and I was so busy making sure everyone knew how much fun I was, I didn’t notice her.\n\nBut once I did notice her, I couldn’t stop. Nell doesn’t push, she doesn’t demand, even though she has stronger opinions than most. But she loves like a fountain, and she is content. These days she homeschools her six children in a small house by a river. She is teaching them the art of contentment by giving them what they need, but not what they demand. She shows them how to be content by being at peace herself. Instead of chasing the world, she has found that her rooms crowded with love hold the very best the world has to offer her.\n\nLight your corner of the world, friends—wherever it may be. And if these excellent duties of love and contentment seem impossible, do not fear; they are impossible. This is why the book of Hebrews was written: to point us always back to our need for Christ. He is our helper, “who promises to never leave us or forsake us” (v.5). \n\nLift your eyes to the eternal glory of Christ, for He is our hope in things both large and small. Any excellence and contentment that flows out of our lives will come from Him. Because of His sanctifying blood, we are made new creatures—creatures capable of hospitality and contentment. Jesus is our hope. He is our strength. And He is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.\n\n",

The book of Leviticus picks up where Exodus ends, with Israel at Mount Sinai receiving the law. Recorded by Moses, it presents God’s instructions for holiness, including regulations for worship, laws on ceremonial cleanliness, moral laws, and instructions for holy days. \nHow Leviticus Fits Into the Story: The book of Leviticus contains instructions for the Israelites on how to worship God and live as His holy people. Studying Leviticus opens up a clearer picture of our holy God and a glimpse at what Jesus Christ’s sacrifice has truly done for us. The sacrificial system was established in order to provide atonement for the sins of Israel, and the writer of Hebrews relied on these images in describing the person and role of Jesus Christ: the sacrifice, the priesthood, and the Day of Atonement (Heb 4:14–10:18).\nReflection Questions: 1.

The book also details the census of Israel, describes the second Passover feast, and reaffirms God’s just judgment in response to continued disobedience. \nHow Numbers Fits Into the Story: By showing us how God responded to the Israelites’ unbelief, the book of Numbers emphasizes the importance of obedience in the Christian life. Numbers demonstrates that there are consequences to our disobedience, while also reminding us that God’s grace remains the same and His redemptive plan will not be stopped. \nReflection Questions: 1.

The book of Deuteronomy, meaning “second law” or “repetition of the law,” contains commentary on the law given to Moses at Mount Sinai, which equipped the covenant community of Israel with instruction on how to live faithfully in their covenant with God. In Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the law to the new generation of Israelites preparing to enter into the promised land after forty years of wandering in the wilderness.   \nHow Deuteronomy Fits Into the Story: Deuteronomy emphasizes the need for God’s law to be internalized into the hearts and minds of God’s people. After the books of Psalms and Isaiah, the New Testament alludes to Deuteronomy more than any other book in the Old Testament. Jesus and the apostles considered the book of Deuteronomy to be vital in their own teaching about God and His relationship with His chosen people and all of humanity. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, He quoted Deuteronomy to rebuke Satan (Lk 4:1–13).\nReflection Questions: 1.

Miraculous events, such as the crossing of the Jordan River, marked the Israelites’ journey. God gave Israel victories, but each victory required a step of faith.

The book of Judges chronicles the period after Joshua’s death, which was characterized by an ongoing cycle of Israel’s sin, God’s judgment, and His deliverance. This deliverance came through twelve leaders, known as judges. \nHow Judges Fits Into the Story: Judges records how the nation of Israel survived the dark days of the judges entirely by the grace of God. In His mercy, God sent oppressors as reminders of their rebellion, responded to their cries, and raised up deliverers. Judges demonstrates the fundamental problem of the human heart—when God’s people forget His saving acts, they go after other gods.

The book of Ruth demonstrates how the Lord shows His covenant faithfulness to His people, often in surprising ways.

It is also a history of the nation’s pattern of sin and repentance, as well as a history of the prophet Samuel’s spiritual leadership during Israel’s transition from theocracy to monarchy.\nHow 1 Samuel Fits Into the Story: God raised up Samuel as a final judge to rule over Israel and call His people back to the Lord, speaking on His behalf. As Samuel advanced in age, the people of Israel continued to reject the Lord and demanded a king like those of other nations. God granted their request, and His covenant faithfulness continued to prepare the way for the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. \nReflection Questions: 1.

The book of 1 Kings recounts the final days of King David’s rule, King Solomon’s prosperous and relatively peaceful reign, and a civil war that divided the nation into two separate kingdoms, both ruled by kings mostly failed to follow God. \nWhat Is 2 Kings? The book of 2 Kings continues where 1 Kings ends, with more stories of the kings in the divided kingdom of Israel and Judah who ignored God and the prophets until both kingdoms fell to other nations. It also chronicles the prophetic ministries of Elijah and Elisha. \nHow 1 & 2 Kings Fit Into the Story: The Jewish exiles in Babylon longed for an explanation for what they saw as the failure of the religious system in Israel that led to their captivity. The books of 1 & 2 Kings were written during this period. These two books interpret Hebrew history in light of Old Testament covenant theology, finding the failure was due not to God but to God’s people, who did not uphold their part of the covenant.

The books of 1 & 2 Chronicles were originally one literary unit. What is now known as 2 Chronicles continues recording the history of Israel from a priestly perspective. It documents the history of Judah from Solomon’s construction of the temple in Jerusalem to the Babylonians taking Judah captive and destroying the temple. \nHow 1 & 2 Chronicles Fit Into the Story: 1 & 2 Chronicles bring together historical events, temple rituals, accounts of sin and judgment, and even some psalms.

The books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book, documenting the rebuilding of Jerusalem once the exiles returned from captivity. The book of Nehemiah records Nehemiah’s leadership in the rebuilding of the walls in Jerusalem. It includes an exhortation to remain faithful to the Lord despite opposition and calls Israel to return to their God in their restored capital.\nHow Ezra & Nehemiah Fit Into the Story: The events in the books of Ezra & Nehemiah—rebuilding the temple, stabilizing Jerusalem, and developing the Jewish community—all played key roles that lead to the life and ministry of Jesus recorded in the Gospels. The role of the rebuilt walls was to protect a functional temple. The temple may not have been as magnificent as Solomon’s, but it would serve as the central place of worship for the Jewish people for centuries until Christ removed the need for a physical temple.\nReflection Questions: 1.

The book of Psalms is a collection of 150 musical poems and prayers written by David and others that represent the full range of human emotion in worshiping God.\nHow Psalms Fits Into the Story: The Psalms are deeply relational and give us a window into who God is, how He acts, and how His people can respond.

Establishing principles, not promises, this book points not only to the potential earthly benefits of wisdom, but also to the greater eternal joy and blessing wisdom brings.

We’ll also read a brief summary of each book and a reflection on how the book fits into the larger story of Scripture. This week, we’ll finish our look at the books of Wisdom Literature and begin the last sections of the Old Testament, the Major and Minor Prophets.\nWhat Is Song of Songs? Song of Songs is a collection of poetry written by King Solomon, or someone writing from his point of view, that celebrates the goodness and beauty of human love and intimacy.\nHow Song of Songs Fits Into the Story: Songs of Songs inspires a pursuit of the love it so beautifully describes: one of emotional intimacy and desire. The book illustrates respect, integrity, and security; devotion through bleak seasons of winter; and renewal in new seasons of spring. It reflects God’s desire to form pure and devoted love within us. It also shows there is potential bliss in married love, reflective of the greater love the Church experiences as the bride of Christ. Song of Songs helps us anticipate the fullness of our relationship with Christ when He returns for His bride.\nReflection Questions: 1.

It also includes a promise of restoration and prophecies of a coming Servant King who will bear their sins. \nHow Isaiah Fits Into the Story: The first part of Isaiah emphasizes sin, the call to repentance, and judgment; the second emphasizes the hope of restoration. Many readers are drawn to Isaiah for the passages describing a future Messiah and those describing the Suffering Servant. But a full reading of the book enriches our understanding of how these prophecies, and more, are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Messiah and Suffering Servant. \nReflection Questions: 1.

This week, we’ll continue looking at the genres of Major and Minor Prophets. \nWhat Is Jeremiah? This book Chronicles God’s prophecies to Judah. The prophet Jeremiah prophecies concerning both Judah’s future captivity captivity in Babylon and the promise of a new covenant. \nWhat Is Lamentations? The book of Lamentations records Jeremiah’s expressions of grief, or laments, over the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah’s captivity in Babylon. It also includes an extended expression of hope in God’s faithful love.\nHow Jeremiah & Lamentations Fit Into the Story: The new covenant passage in Jeremiah 31:31–34 is the longest Old Testament text quoted in the New Testament (Hb 8:8–12). This passage links God’s ancient promises to Eve (Gn 3:15), Abraham (Gn 12:1–3), and David (2Sm 7:16–19) with New Testament assurances that God in Christ grants believers new hearts, salvation, and fellowship with Him.Lamentations invites us to meet God in the midst of our suffering and teaches us the language of prayer. Instead of offering a set of techniques, easy answers, or inspiring slogans for facing pain and grief, the book gives voice to our pain through lament, reorients our focus to the faithfulness of God, and affirms that He is able to sustain us.\nReflection Questions: 1.

This week, we’ll continue looking at the genres of Major and Minor Prophets. \nWhat Is Ezekiel? This book, named after the prophet, is an account of God’s message of judgment and hope to the Jewish exiles in Babylon.\nHow Ezekiel Fits Into the Story: The message of Ezekiel centers on the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Prior to the announcement of Jerusalem’s fall, Ezekiel’s message was one of judgment. After Jerusalem was destroyed and the nation was in exile, Ezekiel’s message became one of hope: God would provide a new heart and a new spirit to enable the people to be faithful and avoid future judgment. He would establish a new temple and a new way of worship for the people once they were restored. The arrangement of the book—announcing judgment in the beginning and declaring restoration at the end—demonstrates that Ezekiel’s message was ultimately one of hope in God’s sovereign mercy. \nReflection Questions: 1.

We’ll also read a brief summary of each book and a reflection on how the book fits into the larger story of Scripture. This week, we’ll continue looking at the genres of Major and Minor Prophets. \nWhat Is Hosea? The book of Hosea recounts how God used the prophet Hosea’s personal life as a representation of Israel’s repeating cycles of sin, repentance, and redemption. This book contrasts the relentless faithfulness of God with the repeated unfaithfulness of His people.\nHow Hosea Fits Into the Story: Hosea compares the relationship between God and His people to the real-life marriage of Hosea and Gomer, drawing a parallel between spiritual and marital unfaithfulness. In buying Gomer’s freedom, Hosea pointed ahead to God’s love perfectly expressed in Christ, who bought the freedom of His bride, the Church, with His own life. Like a marriage partner, God is deeply involved in our lives and pained when we go our own way. Often, God’s people have failed to demonstrate wholehearted love and faithfulness to Him, but nothing can quench God’s love for us. \nReflection Questions: 1. Look back to your reading on day 25.

It includes the prophet’s time in the belly of a fish, his reluctant message to a repentant Nineveh, and his disappointment with God’s mercy toward the people of this ancient Assyrian city. \nHow Jonah Fits Into the Story: The book of Jonah shows that God’s gift of salvation is offered not just to Israel, but to the whole world. It displays God’s power over nature and the futility of ignoring His instruction. Jonah’s time in the fish foreshadows Jesus’s burial and resurrection, pointing to Christ’s ultimate fulfillment of the salvation Jonah himself preached.\nReflection Questions: 1.

While Zephaniah’s immediate purpose was to warn idolatrous Judah of the Lord’s imminent judgment, the ultimate purpose was to call out a “remnant” from all nations to trust in the Lord\nHow Zephaniah Fits Into the Story: While Israel continued to turn away from God, the promise of a remnant, or a group of people left after a catastrophe, illustrates God’s amazing grace alongside His just wrath. God judges the proud and preserves the humble, and Zephaniah invited everyone who humbly obeyed the Lord to seek Him for deliverance.

From beginning to end, the Bible tells the story of God’s redemptive plan, culminating in His triumph over evil through the cross of Jesus Christ. Zechariah’s prophecies anticipate this grand culmination of history, describing a coming glorious King, a God who triumphs over all, and a world with all wrongs corrected.

We’ll also read a brief summary of each book and a reflection on how the book fits into the larger story of Scripture. \nWhat Is Malachi? The book of Malachi rebukes Judah’s sins by quoting their own words, repeating their own thoughts, and describing their own attitudes. As a motivation for obedience, the prophet Malachi pointed to God’s demonstrations of love for Israel, their spiritual and covenant unity with God and one another, and a coming day of salvation and blessing for those who fear Him.\nHow Malachi Fits Into the Story: Malachi is the last prophetic message from God before the close of the Old Testament period. Malachi reminds us that we have a great, loving, and holy God, who has unchanging and glorious purposes for His people. This God calls us to genuine worship, fidelity to Himself and to one another, and expectant faith in what He is doing and says He will do for His people.\nReflection Questions: 1.

The Gospel of Mark is a fast-paced narrative about the ministry of Jesus. Likely written by John Mark, who knew both Peter and Paul, this Gospel emphasizes Jesus as both the Son of Man and the Son of God. It also shows Jesus as a humble servant leader, willing to suffer and die on the cross. \nHow Mark Fits Into the Story: The Gospel of Mark clarifies the nature of the promised Messiah. Though many individuals in Jesus’s day tried to claim the title, Mark redefined it in light of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. Jesus, the one, true Messiah, was a suffering servant, both fully human and fully divine. Mark’s Gospel shows us how Jesus’s authority, in both teaching and miracles, is present alongside His humanity. \nReflection Questions: 1.

He also expresses his joy over the church’s restoration after troubling conflict.\nHow 2 Corinthians Fits Into the Story: Second Corinthians contains some of Paul’s most direct teaching about his role as a pastor. This letter gives a biblical understanding of ministry, the work of God’s people.

He writes that sinners can be justified, or moved from a state of sin to a state of righteousness, through faith in Jesus Christ. This faith, rather than obedience to the law, is what allows for godly living.\nHow Galatians Fits Into the Story: In Galatians, we find a summary of the true gospel: salvation comes through faith in Jesus Christ alone and not the law. In this letter, Paul teaches extensively about the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in the Christian life, including commands to “walk by the Spirit,” “be led by the Spirit,” and to “keep in step with the Spirit.” This submission to the Holy Spirit in every moment is what empowers us to live godly lives and carry out the work of the gospel. \nReflection Questions:1.

In this letter to the church at Ephesus, Paul calls the Ephesian believers to unity in Jesus because of the gift of salvation they have received.

Here, Paul draws a direct connection between belief and behavior. While 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus were not intended to provide a detailed account of church government, they do provide significant insights on the topic, such as a list of characteristics for overseers and deacons. In describing the character and nature of a Christlike leader, the letter also gives a model for all believers.\nReflection Questions: 1.

Paul wrote this short letter to Philemon, a leader of the house church in Colossae, during his first imprisonment in Rome. In it, Paul asks his friend to forgive Onesimus, who was enslaved to Philemon and came to faith after running away and meeting Paul. Paul also asks Philemon to restore Onesimus to his household, demonstrating Christian love by treating him as a brother in Christ.\nHow Philemon Fits Into the Story: Philemon is Paul’s shortest letter, yet it is considered one of his most heartfelt. It also captures the true heart of the gospel. When we come to God in repentance and faith, He gives us a new status in the family of God. He welcomes us as if we were Jesus, who assumed full responsibility for the debt of our sin. \nReflection Questions: 1.

Written by an unknown author, the book of Hebrews explores the majesty and supremacy of Jesus over all things. It connects Israel’s rich history and the Pentateuch to the work of Jesus, our High Priest. Hebrews details how Jesus is the fulfillment of the law and all of God’s promises in the Old Testament.\nHow Hebrews Fits Into the Story: Hebrews ties Old Testament history and practices to the life and ministry of Jesus more than any other book in the New Testament.

Written by James, the brother of Jesus, this book instructs and admonishes readers to seek godly wisdom. It also counsels them to avoid internal conflicts within the Church and to express their faith through good works. James encourages believers to persevere in this calling in spite of trials, as God is faithful to mature His people in the midst of suffering. \nHow James Fits Into the Story: James continually calls for obedience to the law of God, showing believers that their obedience to God’s instruction is an indication of a living faith. Some choose to oversimplify the distinctions between the Old Testament and the New Testament by saying that the Old Testament is grounded in works and the New Testament is grounded in faith. James brings both testaments together to show that faith and works are integrally related in both the old and new covenants.\nReflection Questions: 1. Why does James say to be joyful during trials?

Written by the apostle John, the books of 1, 2 & 3 John describe how believers are to walk in true fellowship with God, actively loving their brothers and sisters in the faith. He writes in these three letters that it is the Holy Spirit who enables us to live this obedient life.\nHow 1, 2 & 3 John Fit Into the Story: First John maps out the three main components of saving knowledge of God: faith in Jesus Christ, obedient response to God’s commands, and true love for God and others. This letter shows how Jesus expects His followers to honor Him daily wherever they are.Second John encourages believers to stay the course, responding to one another with love and the truth of the gospel. This letter challenges readers to remain steadfast in their faith and hope in Jesus Christ, eventually receiving a “full reward” from Him (2Jn 8).Third John underscores central Christian convictions and testifies to the God-centeredness of the Christian faith.
