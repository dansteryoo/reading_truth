We’ll also read a brief summary of each book and a reflection on how the book fits into the larger story of Scripture. This week, we will finish reading the General Epistles and move on to Apocalyptic Literature. \n\nWhat Is Revelation? The apostle John wrote the book of Revelation in exile on Patmos after receiving a vision from the Holy Spirit. The book of Revelation gives readers a picture of Jesus as the King who will one day return to usher in the fullness of His kingdom. Revelation offers important details about the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit, eternity in the presence of God, future judgment against sin, and the reality of the spiritual realm.\n\nHow Revelation Fits Into the Story: The book of Revelation provides a theological overview of many topics central to Christian belief, including events surrounding the end times and the glorified Son of Man. It also stresses the practical choices that all people must make in light of eternity. Revelation provides a holistic view of Jesus as the victorious King of kings, one who is coming back for His bride. It also emphasizes the hope all believers share in His future return. \n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1. What do you find most hopeful about the description of the new Jerusalem in Revelation 21?\n\n2.

This week, we will finish reading the General Epistles and move on to Apocalyptic Literature. \n\nWhat Is Jude? Possibly written by the brother of Jesus and James, the book of Jude urges readers to steward their influence within the church by contending for the faith, remaining vigilant against heresy. They will maintain their unity by remembering their shared salvation in Christ. \n\nHow Jude Fits Into the Story: The letter of Jude has often been overlooked by New Testament scholars because of its short length. However, its message is relevant to believers of every era. Jude sought to protect Christian truth and strongly opposed heretics who threatened the faith, and he called his readers to be just as passionate in their defense of the gospel. \n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This week, we will finish reading the General Epistles and move on to Apocalyptic Literature.\n\nWhat Are 1, 2 & 3 John? Written by the apostle John, the books of 1, 2 & 3 John describe how believers are to walk in true fellowship with God, actively loving their brothers and sisters in the faith. He writes in these three letters that it is the Holy Spirit who enables us to live this obedient life.\n\nHow 1, 2 & 3 John Fit Into the Story:\n\nFirst John maps out the three main components of saving knowledge of God: faith in Jesus Christ, obedient response to God’s commands, and true love for God and others. This letter shows how Jesus expects His followers to honor Him daily wherever they are.\n\nSecond John encourages believers to stay the course, responding to one another with love and the truth of the gospel. This letter challenges readers to remain steadfast in their faith and hope in Jesus Christ, eventually receiving a “full reward” from Him (2Jn 8).\n\nThird John underscores central Christian convictions and testifies to the God-centeredness of the Christian faith. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are not mentioned specifically, but in the writer’s view, both are included when referencing God in this letter (3Jn 1, 3–4, 8, 12).\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This week, we will finish reading the General Epistles and move on to Apocalyptic Literature. \n\nWhat Is 2 Peter? In 2 Peter, the apostle Peter cautions believers against false teachers and immoral behavior. He also emphasizes Christ’s second coming and the importance of an active, growing faith as we await Christ’s return.\n\nHow 2 Peter Fits Into the Story: Second Peter is strongly tied to the Old Testament. In it, Peter highlights the significance of God’s Word through statements on the origin of Scripture, as well as the inspired nature of Paul’s letters. Peter challenges his audience to live with authenticity, clinging to Scripture as a guide for faithful living.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The book of 1 Peter was written by Peter, one of Jesus’s disciples, to encourage Christians living in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). He calls them to stand firm in their faith, abandoning their idolatrous behavior for righteous living in Christ. First Peter centers around the living hope and new life offered to us in the resurrected Jesus. \n\nHow 1 Peter Fits Into the Story: First Peter proclaims that believers have a secure heavenly hope and eternal inheritance. Peter’s message of encouragement in the face of suffering calls us to live lives of love and holiness, glorifying God by imitating Jesus no matter the circumstance. \n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This week, we’ll finish our look at the Pauline Epistles and begin the General Epistles. \n\nWhat Is James? Written by James, the brother of Jesus, this book instructs and admonishes readers to seek godly wisdom. It also counsels them to avoid internal conflicts within the Church and to express their faith through good works. James encourages believers to persevere in this calling in spite of trials, as God is faithful to mature His people in the midst of suffering. \n\nHow James Fits Into the Story: James continually calls for obedience to the law of God, showing believers that their obedience to God’s instruction is an indication of a living faith. Some choose to oversimplify the distinctions between the Old Testament and the New Testament by saying that the Old Testament is grounded in works and the New Testament is grounded in faith. James brings both testaments together to show that faith and works are integrally related in both the old and new covenants.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This week, we’ll finish our look at the Pauline Epistles and begin the General Epistles. \n\nWhat Is Hebrews? Written by an unknown author, the book of Hebrews explores the majesty and supremacy of Jesus over all things. It connects Israel’s rich history and the Pentateuch to the work of Jesus, our High Priest. Hebrews details how Jesus is the fulfillment of the law and all of God’s promises in the Old Testament.\n\nHow Hebrews Fits Into the Story: Hebrews ties Old Testament history and practices to the life and ministry of Jesus more than any other book in the New Testament. Just as Jesus taught that the Old Testament has been fulfilled in Him, Hebrews shows how the old covenant was fulfilled and the new covenant has been extended to us in Him. This glorious future, secured for us in Christ Jesus, gives us a reason to endure in the faith.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1. What “race” do you think the author is referring to in Hebrews 12:1–2?

Paul wrote this short letter to Philemon, a leader of the house church in Colossae, during his first imprisonment in Rome. In it, Paul asks his friend to forgive Onesimus, who was enslaved to Philemon and came to faith after running away and meeting Paul. Paul also asks Philemon to restore Onesimus to his household, demonstrating Christian love by treating him as a brother in Christ.\n\nHow Philemon Fits Into the Story: Philemon is Paul’s shortest letter, yet it is considered one of his most heartfelt. It also captures the true heart of the gospel. When we come to God in repentance and faith, He gives us a new status in the family of God. He welcomes us as if we were Jesus, who assumed full responsibility for the debt of our sin. \n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

It warns against false teachers and gives instruction for how Christians should live because of the grace shown to them in Christ. \n\nHow Titus Fits Into the Story: Paul fought for the spiritual health and maturity of Titus by making clear the connection between a follower of Christ’s faith and their behavior.

Colossians is a letter written by Paul to counter false teaching in the city of Colossae.

He also discusses the practical implications of salvation: because they have been made new in Jesus, their lives as believers should look different from their old lives. \n\nHow Colossians Fits Into the Story: Colossians provides one of the Bible’s fullest expressions of Jesus’s divine identity. This is most evident in the hymn of praise in Colossians 1:15–23, which presents Jesus as the image of the invisible God, the Creator and sustainer of the universe. He is the head of His body, the Church, and the One through whom forgiveness is possible.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1. Jesus is both fully God and fully man.

In this letter, Paul teaches extensively about the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit in the Christian life, including commands to “walk by the Spirit,” “be led by the Spirit,” and to “keep in step with the Spirit.” This submission to the Holy Spirit in every moment is what empowers us to live godly lives and carry out the work of the gospel. \n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

In his second letter to the Corinthian church, Paul defends his ministry as an apostle and describes how Satan has opposed the work of the gospel. He also expresses his joy over the church’s restoration after troubling conflict.\n\nHow 2 Corinthians Fits Into the Story: Second Corinthians contains some of Paul’s most direct teaching about his role as a pastor.

The Corinthian church was struggling to stay faithful to the gospel while living as a part of the larger, non-Christian Corinthian culture. With this in mind, Paul gave practical instruction on love and Christian unity, spiritual gifts and marriage, resurrection and the life of the Church.\n\nHow 1 Corinthians Fits Into the Story: First Corinthians contributes greatly to our understanding of Christian life, ministry, and relationships by showing us how the members of the Church—called the body of Christ—are to function together. Paul gave specific solutions to specific problems the Corinthian church faced. But the underlying answer to every question is the call to live Christ-centered lives in community, no matter the culture or circumstance. \n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This historical account also documents how the early Church was built—person by person in city after city—through the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit. \n\nHow Acts Fits Into the Story: The book of Acts bridges the years between those who walked with Jesus firsthand and those who came to faith through their testimony. This book shows the fulfillment of Jesus’s promise to send the Holy Spirit to His disciples, and how the Holy Spirit sustained, equipped, and grew the early Church.

He also points to how Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecy, festivals, and institutions. \n\nHow John Fits Into the Story: Of all the New Testament books, the Gospel of John most clearly teaches the divine identity of Christ.

Luke places special emphasis on Jesus’s concern for including social outsiders and seeking the lost. Luke is the longest book in the New Testament and contains many stories and teachings found only in this Gospel.\n\nHow Luke Fits Into the Story: Luke’s Gospel has a unique focus on Jesus as a friend of sinners and Savior of the world. In focusing on Jesus as the Son of Man who came to seek and save the lost, this Gospel pays close attention to how Jesus engaged with the marginalized. It also highlights His conversations with the religious leaders of the day, as well as His teachings on the nature of the kingdom of God.

The Gospel of Mark is a fast-paced narrative about the ministry of Jesus. Likely written by John Mark, who knew both Peter and Paul, this Gospel emphasizes Jesus as both the Son of Man and the Son of God. It also shows Jesus as a humble servant leader, willing to suffer and die on the cross. \n\nHow Mark Fits Into the Story: The Gospel of Mark clarifies the nature of the promised Messiah. Though many individuals in Jesus’s day tried to claim the title, Mark redefined it in light of Jesus’s life, death, and resurrection. Jesus, the one, true Messiah, was a suffering servant, both fully human and fully divine.

This Gospel affirms Jesus as the Messiah promised in the Old Testament, and the reigning King who inaugurated the kingdom of God on earth. It also describes Jesus coming to call His people to turn away from their sin and toward Him.\n\nHow Matthew Fits Into the Story: Our introduction to the New Testament, Matthew’s Gospel contains the greatest number of direct connections to the Old Testament while also looking forward to the Messiah’s future return. Matthew writes of Jesus as the climax of salvation history—the fulfillment of every prophecy and promise made to Israel, the incarnate presence and wisdom of God Himself, and the reigning sustainer of the Church.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The book of Malachi rebukes Judah’s sins by quoting their own words, repeating their own thoughts, and describing their own attitudes. As a motivation for obedience, the prophet Malachi pointed to God’s demonstrations of love for Israel, their spiritual and covenant unity with God and one another, and a coming day of salvation and blessing for those who fear Him.\n\nHow Malachi Fits Into the Story: Malachi is the last prophetic message from God before the close of the Old Testament period. Malachi reminds us that we have a great, loving, and holy God, who has unchanging and glorious purposes for His people.

Zechariah also challenged his fellow Israelites to remain faithful to God, who promised them complete restoration when the Messiah brings the kingdom in full.\n\nHow Zechariah Fits Into the Story: The book of Zechariah is heavy with language of judgment, but it is also full of God’s promises. From beginning to end, the Bible tells the story of God’s redemptive plan, culminating in His triumph over evil through the cross of Jesus Christ. Zechariah’s prophecies anticipate this grand culmination of history, describing a coming glorious King, a God who triumphs over all, and a world with all wrongs corrected. These promises set the stage for God’s future kingdom, as evidenced by the quotes and allusions to Zechariah in the New Testament.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The book of Haggai contains a plea from the prophet to the 43,000 Jewish pilgrims returning to Jerusalem from exile. He called them to continue rebuilding the temple and examine the ways they were living their lives as God’s people.\n\nHow Haggai Fits Into the Story: Haggai admonished the Jewish people living in Jerusalem after the exile, urging them to choose God over what made them comfortable. Their response to this challenge would be reflected in their work on the temple.

The book of Zephaniah warns the people of Judah about the consequences of idolatry and urges them to seek the Lord alone before the day of judgment comes. While Zephaniah’s immediate purpose was to warn idolatrous Judah of the Lord’s imminent judgment, the ultimate purpose was to call out a “remnant” from all nations to trust in the Lord.\n\nHow Zephaniah Fits Into the Story: While Israel continued to turn away from God, the promise of a remnant, or a group of people left after a catastrophe, illustrates God’s amazing grace alongside His just wrath. God judges the proud and preserves the humble, and Zephaniah invited everyone who humbly obeyed the Lord to seek Him for deliverance.

Habakkuk’s message that the righteous will live by faith prepared the way for the greater understanding of this truth in the New Testament’s emphasis on salvation through faith in Christ.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This book upholds faith in God’s just government and hope in the triumph of His will. Its message reorients our aching hearts to the truth that God is on His throne and faithfully cares for His own.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The book of Hosea recounts how God used the prophet Hosea’s personal life as a representation of Israel’s repeating cycles of sin, repentance, and redemption. This book contrasts the relentless faithfulness of God with the repeated unfaithfulness of His people.\n\nHow Hosea Fits Into the Story: Hosea compares the relationship between God and His people to the real-life marriage of Hosea and Gomer, drawing a parallel between spiritual and marital unfaithfulness. In buying Gomer’s freedom, Hosea pointed ahead to God’s love perfectly expressed in Christ, who bought the freedom of His bride, the Church, with His own life. Like a marriage partner, God is deeply involved in our lives and pained when we go our own way. Often, God’s people have failed to demonstrate wholehearted love and faithfulness to Him, but nothing can quench God’s love for us.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1. Look back to your reading on day 25.

This week, we’ll continue looking at the genres of Major and Minor Prophets. \n\nWhat Is Ezekiel? This book, named after the prophet, is an account of God’s message of judgment and hope to the Jewish exiles in Babylon.\n\nHow Ezekiel Fits Into the Story: The message of Ezekiel centers on the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Prior to the announcement of Jerusalem’s fall, Ezekiel’s message was one of judgment. After Jerusalem was destroyed and the nation was in exile, Ezekiel’s message became one of hope: God would provide a new heart and a new spirit to enable the people to be faithful and avoid future judgment. He would establish a new temple and a new way of worship for the people once they were restored. The arrangement of the book—announcing judgment in the beginning and declaring restoration at the end—demonstrates that Ezekiel’s message was ultimately one of hope in God’s sovereign mercy.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The prophet Jeremiah prophecies concerning both Judah’s future captivity captivity in Babylon and the promise of a new covenant.\n\nWhat Is Lamentations? The book of Lamentations records Jeremiah’s expressions of grief, or laments, over the destruction of Jerusalem and Judah’s captivity in Babylon. It also includes an extended expression of hope in God’s faithful love.\n\nHow Jeremiah & Lamentations Fit Into the Story:\n\nThe new covenant passage in Jeremiah 31:31–34 is the longest Old Testament text quoted in the New Testament (Hb 8:8–12). This passage links God’s ancient promises to Eve (Gn 3:15), Abraham (Gn 12:1–3), and David (2Sm 7:16–19) with New Testament assurances that God in Christ grants believers new hearts, salvation, and fellowship with Him.\n\nLamentations invites us to meet God in the midst of our suffering and teaches us the language of prayer. Instead of offering a set of techniques, easy answers, or inspiring slogans for facing pain and grief, the book gives voice to our pain through lament, reorients our focus to the faithfulness of God, and affirms that He is able to sustain us.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

This book is a record of Isaiah’s prophecies concerning the nation of Judah’s rebellion against God, His coming judgment, and the call for them to repent and turn back to Him. It also includes a promise of restoration and prophecies of a coming Servant King who will bear their sins.\n\nHow Isaiah Fits Into the Story: The first part of Isaiah emphasizes sin, the call to repentance, and judgment; the second emphasizes the hope of restoration. Many readers are drawn to Isaiah for the passages describing a future Messiah and those describing the Suffering Servant. But a full reading of the book enriches our understanding of how these prophecies, and more, are fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Messiah and Suffering Servant.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

Song of Songs is a collection of poetry written by King Solomon, or someone writing from his point of view, that celebrates the goodness and beauty of human love and intimacy.\n\nHow Song of Songs Fits Into the Story: Songs of Songs inspires a pursuit of the love it so beautifully describes: one of emotional intimacy and desire. The book illustrates respect, integrity, and security; devotion through bleak seasons of winter; and renewal in new seasons of spring. It reflects God’s desire to form pure and devoted love within us. It also shows there is potential bliss in married love, reflective of the greater love the Church experiences as the bride of Christ.

The book of Ecclesiastes, likely written by Solomon, examines practical and philosophical questions, observing that following wisdom doesn’t guarantee a positive outcome. Ecclesiastes wrestles with the tension and difficulties of life.\n\nHow Ecclesiastes Fits Into the Story: Ecclesiastes awakens us to our own mortality, begging us to seriously consider how we should live with the time we’ve been given.

The book of Proverbs contains wisdom sayings, primarily from King Solomon, calling the readers to walk in the way of godly wisdom rather than the world’s foolishness.\n\nHow Proverbs Fits Into the Story: The book of Proverbs presents two paths: one of wisdom and one of foolishness. Establishing principles, not promises, this book points not only to the potential earthly benefits of wisdom, but also to the greater eternal joy and blessing wisdom brings. As Proverbs continually calls us to obedience, we can rest in the truth that conviction is a gift from the Holy Spirit intended for God’s glory and our good.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The book of Psalms is a collection of 150 musical poems and prayers written by David and others that represent the full range of human emotion in worshiping God.\n\nHow Psalms Fits Into the Story: The Psalms are deeply relational and give us a window into who God is, how He acts, and how His people can respond. The struggle to understand how God’s attributes—particularly His sovereignty and goodness—relate to life experiences is a major theme throughout the Psalms. These words, often in the form of prayers, were written by people who had not lost their faith in God as they navigated the mountaintops and valleys of life.

The book of Ezra records the Jewish people’s return to Jerusalem from their Babylonian captivity, the ongoing rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem, and the people’s recommitment to the law, led by the scribe Ezra.\n\nWhat Is Nehemiah? The books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book, documenting the rebuilding of Jerusalem once the exiles returned from captivity. The book of Nehemiah records Nehemiah’s leadership in the rebuilding of the walls in Jerusalem. It includes an exhortation to remain faithful to the Lord despite opposition and calls Israel to return to their God in their restored capital.\n\nHow Ezra & Nehemiah Fit Into the Story: The events in the books of Ezra & Nehemiah—rebuilding the temple, stabilizing Jerusalem, and developing the Jewish community—all played key roles that lead to the life and ministry of Jesus recorded in the Gospels. The role of the rebuilt walls was to protect a functional temple. The temple may not have been as magnificent as Solomon’s, but it would serve as the central place of worship for the Jewish people for centuries until Christ removed the need for a physical temple.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

The books of 1 & 2 Kings were written during this period. These two books interpret Hebrew history in light of Old Testament covenant theology, finding the failure was due not to God but to God’s people, who did not uphold their part of the covenant.

In His mercy, God sent oppressors as reminders of their rebellion, responded to their cries, and raised up deliverers. Judges demonstrates the fundamental problem of the human heart—when God’s people forget His saving acts, they go after other gods.

In Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the law to the new generation of Israelites preparing to enter into the promised land after forty years of wandering in the wilderness.   \n\nHow Deuteronomy Fits Into the Story: Deuteronomy emphasizes the need for God’s law to be internalized into the hearts and minds of God’s people. After the books of Psalms and Isaiah, the New Testament alludes to Deuteronomy more than any other book in the Old Testament.

Numbers demonstrates that there are consequences to our disobedience, while also reminding us that God’s grace remains the same and His redemptive plan will not be stopped.\n\nReflection Questions:\n\n1.

Studying Leviticus opens up a clearer picture of our holy God and a glimpse at what Jesus Christ’s sacrifice has truly done for us. The sacrificial system was established in order to provide atonement for the sins of Israel, and the writer of Hebrews relied on these images in describing the person and role of Jesus Christ: the sacrifice, the priesthood, and the Day of Atonement (Heb 4:14–10:18).\n\nReflection Questions: \n\n1.

		"devo_summary": "\n\nAsk anyone who regularly communicates to a group what the hardest part of putting together their presentation is, and they will often tell you (or at least I will) that it is coming up with the conclusion. It’s usually the last part of my preparation for preaching each week. Oftentimes I feel like I’m just slamming the plane on the runway from about 15,000 feet; we eventually come to a stop, but it can be a bumpy landing before we do.\n\nMaybe the writer of Hebrews was familiar with this same feeling. After masterfully calling his listeners to not abandon following Christ, he seems to run off a hit-list of items he wanted to get in before he finished, but perhaps didn’t have the time to fully develop. These powerful last words, however, are instructive; they don’t need much explanation because they call us to a life of truly following Christ. This final list is a matter of living in light of having a far superior Savior in Jesus. The author’s conclusion brings us to the unchanging, glorious Savior and how we should live in light of His grace.\n\nWith Jesus as our unchanging Savior, we can love others well, serve the stranger, care for those suffering for the sake of the gospel, honor the institution of marriage, live simply, and show regard for those who communicate the gospel to us. Because Jesus is unchanging in His grace toward us, we can reject false teaching and bear up under suffering, while following and praying for our leaders, and continuing to do good as we have opportunity. Jesus’s faithfulness toward us assures us that He will work these good things in us and through us.\n\nIn this final passage of Hebrews, we are met with a powerful reflection on the enduring faithfulness of Christ to us. Only through the grace of God and the constancy of Christ—who is the same yesterday, today, and forever—are we redeemed from our sins and empowered to live for God’s glory. \n\nThis exhortation we have been reading the last few weeks is a powerful call to be men who have our lives centered and focused on Christ. This kind of life is one of faith, love, and glory, where we trust God’s promises over what we can see. \n\nMay we always put our hope in the eternal Savior who is superior in every way.\n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

		"devo_title": "Warning Against Rejecting God’s Grace",
		"devo_summary": "\n\nGod is gracious. God is kind. God is loving. God is a consuming fire?\n\nScripture is full of passages of comfort, but today we examine one that is actually a stern warning and reminder. It is true that “God is love” (1 John 4:8), but it is also true that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (Proverbs 9:10).\n\nOne of the starkest reminders of the danger of rejecting God’s grace is found in the case of Esau. You’ll remember that in a moment of weakness and extreme hunger, Esau sold his birthright as the eldest son to his younger brother Jacob. To make matters worse, he sold it for a cup of stew (Genesis 25:27–34).\n\nWhile I know Esau acted rashly and unwisely, there’s a part of me that’s always felt sorry for him. Did he really understand what he was giving away? Surely, he must have. Yet he was willing to forsake all of his inheritance, his rights, his future lands, and his stake in the family name in exchange for instant gratification. There’s some significant personal irresponsibility here. Certainly, when he had a full belly and came to his senses, Esau must have realized the massive mistake he made. Yet it was too late to turn things around (Hebrews 12:17).\n\nThe writer of Hebrews issues a strong caution, one that was meant to rouse the attention of his first-century readers, and still causes us to do a double take today. His words about Esau are stern: “For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, even though he sought it with tears, because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance” (Hebrews 12:17).\n\nWhile the Father’s heart is loving, lavish, and long-suffering toward us, Hebrews 12 reminds us that we should not play fast and loose with those luxuries. Paul puts it another way, “What should we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may multiply? Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it?” (Romans 6:1–2).\n\nGod’s grace comes freely, but it’s not cheap. If you’ve handed your life over to God through Jesus, you’ve found freedom, but it was bought for a price. The writer of Hebrews expresses an important corrective to two different types of readers. The first is the person who has heard the invitation to salvation but, for whatever reason, hasn’t made the leap of faith yet. The second is the reader who knows Jesus but is consistently eyeing the ways of the world, wondering if there might be something better, more fulfilling “over there.”\n\nPerhaps you find yourself in one of those places today—unsure of the invitation to repentance and restoration, or perhaps not as enamored with the Christian life as you once were. Wherever you stand, the writer of Hebrews brings a loving challenge today: God is loving, compassionate, and generous, but it’s not wise to play with fire. Once you’ve tasted the goodness of God, be sure not to reject His loving redemption.\n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nThe Beverly Hillbillies was a 1960s sitcom about the Clampett family: a poor, backwoods family who lived in the Ozark mountains. While out hunting for dinner, family patriarch, Jed Clampett, fires his rifle at an animal and accidentally strikes oil. That oil comes bubbling up from the ground, and they realize their property is an oil field. So overnight, they go from dirt-poor to filthy rich, their wealth literally pouring out from the dirt. And then the rest of the series is about these backwoods hillbillies moving to luxurious Beverly Hills and being totally out of place there.\n\nNow, some prosperity gospel, health-and-wealth preachers might say this is the normal Christian life. If you’re dirt poor, just have faith, keep believing, support their ministry, and eventually you’ll strike it rich—God will give you all the money and stuff you could ever want. But that’s not Jesus’s story as told in our passage today. Hebrews 12 is a reminder that Jesus Himself suffered, and it is a call to endure the hardship, struggle, and discipline that will surely come when we follow Him.\n\nJesus would have been the worst prosperity preacher of all time: He left the riches of heaven to enter the poverty of this world. Being determined to do His Father’s will all the way to the cross meant He had few friends, no permanent home, and a ministry that went from thousands of cheering admirers to even His closest friends abandoning Him in His hour of greatest need. No, Jesus preaches a different kind of health and wealth. He promises not physical riches, but spiritual ones—eternal ones. \n\nThe gospel is not a promise of a full bank account; it’s a promise of heavenly riches even in earthly poverty. It’s a promise of life even in the face of death. Like Jesus, we are called to look suffering in the face and endure it with joy. In Him, we don’t merely survive suffering, we overcome it. \n\nThe truth is, we’re all spiritual Clampetts. We’re dirt-poor misfits who become filthy rich: our riches come up from the dirt of death to the abundance of resurrection life. Our residence in God’s Kingdom may seem as unlikely as hillbillies in Beverly Hills, but our citizenship and inheritance have been secured by Christ (Philippians 3:20, 1 Peter 1:3-4). \n\nHear the good news today: our suffering is no surprise to God, and in His kindness it is not wasted. He refines us in love, “so that we can share his holiness” (Hebrews 12:10). In our struggle, we can look to Jesus, who endured the cross and sent us the Holy Spirit to strengthen our weak hands and wobbly knees. May our own endurance be for His glory. \n\nWritten by Brandon D. Smith\n\n                ",

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame would be pretty cool to see too. Out of the great many singers and bands who have risen up the charts, only a select few make into the Hall. But enough Hall of Fame talk, because Hebrews 11 isn’t really a Hall of Fame or a Hall of Faith, despite it sometimes being described that way. Let’s put a cease-and-desist order on that.\n\nHalls of Fame are meant to separate the greats from the not-greats, the famous from the ordinary. No one visits the Basketball Hall of Fame and walks away thinking he can imitate Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game, or Yao Ming’s 7’6” height, or Michael Jordan’s gravity-defying dunks. You leave a Hall of Fame in awe of their greatness, not hoping to imitate what you see. But that’s not the point the writer of Hebrews is making.\n\nHebrews 11 exists for your imitation. God didn’t give us this section of the Bible for us to think, Look at these great followers of God. Too bad I’ll never be like them. The barrage of “by faiths” in the chapter are meant to weave us together with these Bible characters, joining us with them in the unfolding story of God’s glory. Like these saints of old, we, too, can walk by faith. God did great things through them, and He can do great things through us too. \n\nIn other words, Hebrews 11 doesn’t exist to museumify those who came before us. It is there to motivate and encourage us to believe that if these folks could live by faith, so can we. We know the crucified and risen Christ too. We’ve been joined to Him by faith, and we can walk through our temptations, sufferings, and joys, looking to Him. So go ahead and plant that church, start that Bible study at your office, invite your Muslim coworker over for dinner. Do it all by faith, trusting God to lead you and help you each step of the way.  \n\nOur biblical ancestors show us that by faith we, too, can endure and walk with God. We can look to the crucified and risen Lord Jesus and endure with Him till the end. There’s a great cloud of witnesses, testifying that faith is what we need to follow Jesus. So whatever lies ahead of you today or tomorrow, go by faith in the gospel of grace.\n\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

Sometime during middle school, my parents finally decided we needed a new family computer, and I was ecstatic because I knew it would be able to play a bunch of new games our old one couldn’t. This was before two-day Amazon delivery, and it felt like I waited months for the UPS man to drop off our new computer, when it really only took a week or two. I was hoping and waiting with eager anticipation for that computer to come. Some days I wondered if it ever would. My faith wavered.\n\nIn Hebrews 11, we find a beautiful, brief definition of faith, and then a handful of examples of people from the Bible who demonstrated faith. Because Hebrews 11 strikes such a victorious chord of triumphant faith, it’s tempting to read through the chapter spending most of our time admiring these faithful followers of God and their tremendous acts of faith. Reading about them can be faith-building, but I want to focus on the first two verses of the chapter, which are foundational to understanding faith, though sometimes overlooked.\n\nVerses 1–2 say, “Now faith is the reality of what is hoped for, the proof of what is not seen. For by it our ancestors won God’s approval.” These verses, especially verse one, can seem a bit cryptic. What does the author mean by “the reality of what is hoped for” or “the proof of what is not seen”? How is faith “reality” or “proof”?\n\nIn his commentary on Hebrews, Be Confident: Live by Faith, Not by Sight, Warren Wiersbe writes, “True Bible faith is confident obedience to God’s Word in spite of circumstances and consequences.” God has spoken to us through His Word about things both seen and unseen, and faith is trusting that what He says is true, especially about the things we can’t see. His Word describes “reality,” and is all the “proof” we need to believe. \n\nThe entire Christian life is meant to run on faith, not sight. We read that God’s approval is “won” by faith (v.2), and that “without faith it is impossible to please God” (v.6). Why does faith matter so much to God? Because our faith brings Him glory. When we take Him at His word, He shows Himself faithful and accomplishes His will through us. The Scriptures testify again and again that walking by faith is part of the normal Christian life. It isn’t just for elite Christians, but for all Christians, including you and me.   \n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nWhen I was a freshman in high school, I got to attend my first college football game. It was a surreal experience for me to see our local college team. I was a big fan. Let’s face it; I’m still a big fan! But what made this day unforgettable was that we had all-access tickets. My friend’s uncle, who worked for the visiting school’s football program, had asked him to come and be a ball boy on the sidelines. I didn’t get to carry equipment and meet players like my friend did (I’m still a little jealous), but we did get free tickets and the chance to see the locker room before the game.\n\nI can remember approaching the security guard outside the locker room door. My friend’s uncle simply said, “They’re with me,” and just like that, we were in.\n\nDo you know what’s more incredible than an all-access ticket to a football game? Hebrews tells us that we can boldly enter into the very presence of God. In today’s passage, we read:\n\n“Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful” (Hebrews 10:22–23).\n\nIf we’re with Jesus, we can confidently draw near to God in worship, prayer, and communion. His new covenant sacrifice has washed us clean. So, we can walk right in. \n\nCan you imagine if my friend and I had tried to get into that locker room without his uncle? The security guard would’ve turned us right around. The same is true for those who approach God apart from Christ. Hebrews tells us that Jesus’s sacrifice is the only way we can be saved. If we reject Christ and go on deliberately and defiantly sinning, even after learning the truth of the gospel, we’ll find ourselves out of options (v.26). Judgment is coming for all. And if we’re not with Jesus, entering into God’s presence at the judgment will be a fearful thing. The author of Hebrews states it plainly: \n\n“It’s a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God” (v.31). \n\nBeing with the Savior or without Him makes all the difference. This is so important to remember—especially when difficulty comes and our faith is tested. The church to which the author of Hebrews wrote had experienced conflict, suffering, public insults, imprisonment, and the confiscation of their property (vv.32–34). They endured all this hardship because they knew that with Christ there are better and more lasting rewards. \n\nFriends, don’t throw away your confidence in Christ. Don’t throw away your credentials! Stay with Jesus, and one day you’ll be richly rewarded (v.35). Then, it will be said of you: “But we are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and are saved” (v.39).\n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nWhen work is done, we sit down. After a long day at the office, after tough yard work, there is nothing that says we’re finished like sitting down and resting. In fact, if you are like me, you might even get a little irritated when you need to get up again because there is something else to do. It seems like the work never ends, doesn’t it? I’ve often reflected on this reality when reading Hebrews 10:12, “But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.”\n\nIn ancient Israel, the work of offering animal sacrifices seemed to have no end. The perpetual sacrifices offered by the priest for the forgiveness of the people’s sins were a continual reminder that more needed to be done. Since the people could not rid themselves of their sinfulness, the need for atoning sacrifices was always before them. There was no finality. There was no rest. There was no end in sight. For this reason, the writer of Hebrews reminds us that Jesus is the true and greater sacrifice for sin. In contrast to the priests who made daily sacrifices, “by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified” (v.14). \n\nAfter Jesus’s resurrection and ascension, He entered the presence of God and sat down, having completed His work. No more sacrifices are needed. There is nothing else to do for the forgiveness of sin. Jesus sits at the right hand of God reminding us that we are not saved by what we do, but by what He has done. Jesus is the Lamb slain for us. He has made peace between God and us. He has taken our guilt upon Himself. He has conquered sin and death. Jesus didn’t just die for us; He died instead of us—in our place.\n\nIf you are a Christian, remember that the shout from the cross, “It is finished” (John 19:30), wasn’t a cry of defeat but a declaration of victory. It is a victory cry because Jesus is seated on the throne, not buried in a tomb. Praise God that in Christ we have a perfect sacrifice for sin, and He is more than sufficient to save. And thus, the salvation offered by Christ is perfect in every way and eternal in its effect. But also remember that while He is seated now, there is coming a day when He will rise from His throne. Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead (2 Timothy 4:1). And on that day, every tongue will confess that He is Lord, either in thankfulness or in terror.\n\nUntil He rises to return, the question for all of us is this: Are we resting in the perfect work of Jesus Christ? The alternatives—running from God in rebellion, or working to earn God’s favor by our good behavior and religious activities—are exhausting, futile pursuits. The work is finished. Christ has done it. We can rest. \n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nIn a letter written to Jean-Baptiste Le Roy in 1789, Benjamin Franklin made the now famous statement: \n\n“Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” \n\nDeath is the inevitable end for each of us. For many, the thought of death is terrifying because our consciences bear witness to the truth that after we die there awaits a day of judgment in which we will be held accountable for all we have ever done. The Christian need not fear death, though. The Scriptures bear witness to the certainty of death and judgment in order to hold out hope for the forgiveness of sins through the death of the God-Man, Jesus Christ, and His subsequent return on the last day, when the dead in Christ are raised to new life in Him.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews emphasizes the greatness of the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. When contrasting it with the weakness of the old covenant’s sacrificial system, the writer highlights the need for the continual sacrificing of calves and goats. The repetition of these sacrifices indicated that sin remained. If these sacrifices had been able to permanently take away sin, they would have ceased. By contrast, “[Jesus] has appeared one time, at the end of the ages, for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself” (Hebrews 9:26). He cannot and will never need to be re-sacrificed. There is permanence to the one sacrifice of Christ on the cross for the sins of His people.\n\nIn order to drive home the point of the one-time, definitive nature of Jesus’s sacrificial death on the cross, the writer explains the mechanics of death and redemption. He sums up the history of redemption in the following way: “And just as it is appointed for people to die once—and after this, judgment—so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him” (Hebrews 9:27–28). The one-time, definitive sacrifice of Jesus secures resurrection glory for His people when Jesus returns.\n\nThis precious truth has huge implications for our souls today. When we look to the crucified Son of God, we are assured that He has fully paid for our sins. They all have been nailed to the cross—nothing more is required. His one-time sacrifice for sin means we need not fear death and judgment. For the believer, there is nothing more sure than the finished work of Christ on the cross, and His coming again in glory for our salvation. This gives us great encouragement and strength to persevere with hope.\n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

Because of our age gap, Bill could tell me stories about growing up in Detroit and going to the old Tiger Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull avenues. His eyes would light up when he told me about the character of the stadium and the historic events he’d witnessed there. He would say that, in some ways, Tiger Stadium was a sacred place to him. When we would talk about the modern-era Tigers and the new Comerica Park, Bill’s eyes didn’t light up in that same way. For Bill, there was something special about the old park that retained its grandeur even after its glory had long passed.\n\nThe first recipients of the sermonic letter we call Hebrews seemed to have a similarly nostalgic perspective on the ministry of the priests at the temple. To them, the temple was the prescribed place of worship, and the priests were responsible servants to help them clear their consciences. But the writer of Hebrews contends that the old temple, and the old practices of the temple, were just a “symbol” (Hebrews 9:9) that pointed to the more glorious and better ministry of Christ.\n\nWhile the priests of the old order had to offer sacrifices on an annual basis to cleanse the consciences of sinful people, Jesus’s ministry as a priest is far greater. Instead of having to offer a sacrifice once a year before God, Christ has entered the presence of God by His own cross to obtain eternal redemption, purification, and life, so that we can serve God faithfully (vv.12–14). He stands as the one who, by His sacrificial death, perfectly represents us before God so that we receive all the blessings of God in Him. \n\nAnd yet, there still can be times when we’re tempted to go back to some of the things we did before we came to know Christ. We look at the supposed freedom we had before following Christ and long for easier days. Like the first readers of Hebrews, we can be deceived into thinking that the hardships that come with following Christ validate our stepping back into our former way of life. There are all kinds of pulls for our hearts to believe that the old way, the old place, the old worship was better than what we have now.\n\nBrothers, let it sink into your heart that “the good things that have come” (v.11)—the good life—is only found in Christ. So let’s fix our eyes on Him and not turn back.  \n\nWritten by Jeremy Writebol\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\n“Forgive, but don’t forget.” — Unknown\n\nThere is a certain earthly logic in being willing to extend forgiveness but not forgetfulness for significant wrongs and wounds we’ve suffered. Much of our international politics in the twenty-first century is predicated on this kind of thinking. Heads of state put aside differences and extend either explicit or implicit forgiveness to their global allies, enemies, and neighbors. Yet, they don’t completely forget their ideological differences and past conflicts. \n\nOn an interpersonal level, wrongs and wounds are also complicated to resolve. All of us have been in situations, probably even this week, where we’ve been hurt by others or we’ve hurt others. While these times are not representative of us at our best, they are regular occurrences in our post-Genesis 3 world and impact how we relate to one another.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews continues to explain how Jesus is our Great High Priest, far exceeding all who came before Him. He is a better mediator of a superior covenant between God and humanity. In stark contrast to the uneasy covenants, shaky treaties, and tentative agreements that govern our world and relationships, the covenant God establishes with us through Jesus is solely dependent upon the power and goodness of one party, and that party is not us but God. Though we frequently, consistently, and brazenly sin against God, He frequently, consistently, and tenderly forgives us on account of Christ’s atoning sacrifice for our sins. \n\nGod also “forgets” our sins in the sense of choosing not to remember them. There’s no lingering grudge, ongoing distrust, or probationary period with God. He does not drag up the past. The slate has been wiped clean—completely clean. David captured this amazing reality in vivid, memorable language in Psalm 103: “As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us” (v.12). Our sins have been removed an infinite distance from us so that God could move intimately close to us. \n\nWe tend to have short memories when it comes to remembering God’s mercy and forgiveness. But if we’ve come to know God through Jesus, then God is actually the one with the short memory. For He promises, “I will remember their sins no more” (Hebrews 8:12). He chooses not to look at us and see our sin. Thanks be to God for His unending mercy and grace. \n\nWritten by Andrew Stoddard\n\n                ",

But we know from experience that the latest and greatest updates do not always match their promotional hype. Newer is not always better.\n\nNevertheless, the possibility of occasional letdowns does not discourage us from taking advantage of significant leaps in technology. We know that advances in science and industry do lead to some wonderful inventions. An automobile is better than a horse and buggy, steel-toed work boots provide much more support and protection than primitive sandals, a phone is a much quicker way to contact someone than the Pony Express, and thanks to anesthetics, surgery today is much more bearable than in centuries past. So, while the claims for the latest “life-changing” product deserve a certain level of scrutiny, there are many instances where the claims have some truth to them. \n\nThroughout Scripture, God institutes priests to make atonement for His people. Like us, they couldn’t shake their sin no matter how hard they tried. A priest represented the people for the Lord in helping remove the weight of sin through the sacrificial system God commanded. As the Israelites wandered in the wilderness in the book of Numbers, Aaron was first appointed to carry this mantle of the priesthood. In places like Zechariah 6, we see the Israelites longing for the day when their final priest would come. God promised a newer and better covenant fulfilled by a new and better priest.\n\nIn Jesus, that promise of a new and better priest has come true. The priests of God throughout biblical history had a role to play, but were ultimately pointing forward to Jesus, who is both the final priest and the final sacrifice of the new covenant between God and man. As Hebrews 8:6 says, “Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.”\n\nIn the case of Jesus, newer really is better. He has a superior ministry based on a better covenant and better promises. We don’t need to look around for a better sacrifice. We don’t need to search for a better salvation. We only need to look at Jesus, our risen Priest and King.\n\nWritten by Brandon Smith \n\n                ",

All I remember are three sentences uttered by the teacher. “Boys, one day you will die. If the good you have done outweighs the bad, you will get to go to heaven. If your bad outweighs the good, you will go to hell.”\n\nWords could not describe the sense of panic that set in as I attempted to do the math on how far behind I was. I figured I had done way more bad than good during the time I had lived, so it would take at least ten to twelve years of almost perfect living to catch up. Then I remembered how much I liked the bad things I did, so I wasn’t sure how I could turn things around. Plus, we learned in church that sin starts in the heart, so the bad things we think are sinful as well. I came to the inevitable conclusion that my situation was hopeless. Sadly, in my ponderings about my own sinfulness, lack of goodness, and eternal life, Jesus never crossed my mind.\n\nToday’s Scripture passages offer good news that destroys both our excessive guilt and our futile attempts at self-justification. In chapter 7, the writer of Hebrews argues for the superiority of Jesus’s priesthood (vv.11–28). It’s a different line of argument from the one he uses at other places in the book.\n\nThe author of Hebrews draws from Genesis 14 and Psalm 110 to show that Jesus is a great high priest after the order of Melchizedek. The priests under the Levitical priesthood could not continue in their service perpetually because death prevented them from doing so. However, since Christ lives forever, He fulfills the promise made through David in Psalm 110 that He would have an everlasting priesthood. In this way, “Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant” (Hebrews 7:22).\n\nIn other passages in Hebrews, the author shows that Jesus is a merciful and faithful high priest because He took on our humanity and can sympathize with our weaknesses. In chapter 7, he instead emphasizes Jesus’s perfect life as the qualification for His eternal priesthood. He stresses that Christ has no sins of His own to atone for, but rather He is “holy, innocent, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens” (v.26). Christ’s priesthood offers us hope because He lived a sinless life on our behalf and now sits at the right hand of God in His glorious perfection.\n\nJohn shows us in 1 John 2:1 why we should trust Christ, our Great High Priest. He says he was writing so they might not sin. He follows this with what I believe to be the most humorous conditional clause in all of Scripture: “But if anyone does sin… ” Not just “anyone” is going to sin. We all have sinned in serious and tragic ways. Yet John points us to our advocate before the Father, “Jesus Christ the righteous one,” emphasizing Christ’s perfect righteousness deliberately because His perfect righteousness is our only hope before a holy God.\n\nWe experience real guilt when we sin, and rightly so. We feel a separation from the Father and are tempted to shrink back from coming into His presence because of the weight of our sin. When that happens, we must look to Jesus, the perfect high priest and our righteous advocate. He gives us His righteousness so that we can stand before the Father knowing the same blessing and approval Jesus does.\n\nWritten by Scott Slayton\n\n                ",

Commentaries are not meant to be read like that. But such was my hunger in the face of my ignorance. I don’t remember much from that book, but I do remember one particular section that affected me.\n\nIn Hebrews chapter 6, the author connects the promise made to Abraham to the promise made to us in Christ. When I read that, and the notes on that passage, I was undone. It was like that moment when you have all the puzzle pieces in front of you, and they finally begin to make sense. When God made the promise to Abraham, He swore by the highest thing there was—Himself. He was the guarantee of His faithfulness to the promise made to Abraham. \n\nI can remember understanding for the first time that Christ gave His life for us because we weren’t faithful and had broken God’s covenant. Christ, who is God, not only kept covenant, but also died as a fully human representative for those who could not keep covenant. When I, as a young college student, saw that God in Christ was the guarantee of His love for us, my mind was blown. It changed everything.\n\nFast-forward twenty-plus years. What had blown my mind as a young man was beginning to penetrate my weary heart. Four in the morning was becoming a time I was well-acquainted with. And the fears and worries that reared their ugly heads the minute I awoke were also becoming unwelcome companions. In these times, my temptation is to make promises to God. If I’m fearful about one of my children, I make a promise to do better as a parent. If I’m worried about work, I try to bargain with God to secure His help with my job. I forget the promise that God has already made and kept, and this forgetfulness leads to a lack of hope. \n\nI’m someone who has every reason to hope but often forgets where hope lies. I keep living as if my hope is in what I do. My own works, and promises of more and better works, are far too often my hope and refuge at 4 a.m., and trust me, they bring no comfort. But when I can finally get a sane thought, I remember what I learned as a young man: “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure“ (Hebrews 6:19).\n\nSleep doesn’t always come.

I miss them when I get in my truck. Her car warns you if someone is in your blind spot. It warns you if you are too close to a wall or another car in front. A backup camera and flashing lights alert you to what’s going on behind you. Warnings are gifts, and Hebrews 6 is a flashing light.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews is alerting this group of Jewish Christians to watch out for the temptation to go back to Judaism, thinking that Jesus isn’t really the Messiah. They are getting hung up on some of the basic teachings and hurdles they’ve already jumped. They don’t need to repent from the dead works of Judaism—they’ve already done that if they are in Christ (v.1). They don’t need another lesson on the place of cleansing rituals—they are already clean and righteous in Christ (v.2). But the lights are still flashing.\n\nApparently, some in their group had already turned away from Christ and gone back to Judaism. Even though they knew something of the freedom and joy that is offered in Christ, they ultimately rejected it. They didn’t really believe in Christ and the value of His crucifixion. Verse 6 puts it in stark terms: “To their own harm, they are recrucifying the Son of God and holding him up to contempt.” In their rejection of Christ, they were saying His crucifixion was deserved because He wasn’t really the sinless Son of God.\n\nNo genuine believer can imagine himself saying and believing such things. True Christians know Jesus didn’t deserve to be crucified—we did. He was crucified for our sins. He should not be mocked and held in contempt. God has highly exalted Him and given Him a name that is above every name (Philippians 2:9). He deserves worship and loyalty, not dishonor and rejection. \n\nDo you see what the writer of Hebrews is doing? He is warning the church that not everyone who appears to be a believer really is. Just because some people attend church for a time, or have some understanding of the gospel, doesn’t mean they have truly trusted in Christ for salvation. It’s the same in our churches today. \n\nSeeing some of their number depart from Christ was no doubt discouraging to these suffering believers, so he reminds them that “God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you demonstrated for his name by serving the saints—and by continuing to serve them” (Hebrews 6:10). God saw their faithfulness and perseverance, and He sees yours too. Whatever you are facing today—temptations, doubts, fears—let the reality of the risen Christ strengthen you. You will remain faithful to the end because Christ has already been faithful, and He promises to never leave you or forsake you.\n\nWritten by Jeff Medders\n\n                ",

I learned all sorts of helpful tips that weekend, but my biggest takeaway could be summed up as: Get in the game. Don’t just talk about prayer or think about prayer or wait until you have just the right system or motivation to pray, but actually begin praying in any and every situation you can. Don’t hold back. Pray often, pray honestly, pray imperfectly (which you will), but pray. Get in the game.\n\nChildren can lead the way here. Think about it: they ask for what they want, unconcerned with their motives or having just the right words or whether or not it’s a good time to be asking. They make their requests known, fully expecting their parents to be able to give them what they need or want. It’s no wonder Jesus said, “Don’t try to keep them from coming to me, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” (Matthew 19:14). Jesus is not turned off by need and desire, but moves toward it.\n\nHebrews 4:14 describes Jesus as our “great high priest.” In the Old Testament, a priest served as a mediator between God and the people of God. This priest was human, of course, and so was weak and sinful, just like us. He knew what it felt like to desperately need God’s mercy and grace. As a fellow sinner, the offerings he made to God on behalf of the people were also made to cover his own sins. While he was called by God to represent the people, he was not above the people.\n\nJesus was also called by God to serve as our high priest. “He did not exalt himself” to that role (Hebrews 5:5). Because He lived a sinless life, His sacrifice was a sufficient and permanent offering to God. And yet His sinlessness does not mean He is unable to sympathize with us. He was “tempted in every way as we are” (Hebrews 4:15). And “during his earthly life, he offered prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears” (Hebrews 5:7). Jesus knows what it feels like to be human. He is our Great High Priest, but He has been in low places. He is not an unapproachable Savior.\n\nAnd so Hebrews 4:16 offers this exhortation and invitation: “Let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need.” In light of who Jesus is (great, and sympathetic to our needs) and in light of what He has done (provided a permanent sacrifice for sin) we can and must approach God with unashamed boldness, fully expecting Him to give us the mercy and grace we need. He delights to do so, for He is a merciful and gracious God. \n\nWritten by Matt Erickson\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nThis summer I endured one of the most stressful weeks of my life. We led a fun but exhausting youth retreat, I traveled for work, a close family friend passed away, one of our cars got a flat tire at a bad time, the other car was damaged in a hit-and-run the night before we were supposed to take it home for the funeral (and there weren’t any rentals available in town)—and the list goes on.\n\nIt was a rough week. But when we went home for the funeral, we had a couple of days of much-needed rest, and it felt like we had finally reached a quiet oasis in a desert of noise and stress.\n\nAs great as that felt, Hebrews 4 reminds us that in Christ we have a much greater rest than can be found in a quiet weekend away from the busyness of daily life. Scholars debate about what the author of Hebrews means by the “rest” found in Christ. Does it mean our rest in eternity? Does it mean rest from working for our salvation? Theologically, both are true, but the emphasis here seems to be on enjoying our future rest today. \n\nWe can find refuge and rest in the finished work of Christ today because we are not responsible for securing the salvation rest we will receive in eternity. Hebrews 4:10 says, “For the person who has entered his rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from his.” The only way we can enjoy the rest God wants to give us is to rest from our own works.  \n\nThe good news of the gospel is that all the work necessary for our salvation was completed by Jesus through His life, death, and resurrection. While we are called to lives of obedience to God’s Word, we are not called to live a life of anxious striving, desperately trying to obey God’s law in order to earn His love. Christ has done for us what we couldn’t do for ourselves. He has fulfilled the law perfectly on our behalf. We can rest in that. We must rest in that or have no rest at all.   \n\nThe grace of God is hard for us to understand. The idea that a reward as great as eternity in the presence of God would be granted to us with no consideration for whether or not we earned it is just plain hard for us to wrap our heads around. It seems too good to be true, which is precisely the point—God’s grace is meant to amaze us. We need faith to believe the gospel.  \n\nSometime soon, whether a Saturday morning, a night during the week, or perhaps on a day off, take some time to rest. And don’t just rest physically. Don’t just take a nap or leisurely work in your garden. Take some time to rest in the promise that your eternity is secure because of the finished work of Christ, not because of how obedient you’ve been. Repent of any and all self-salvation projects, believe the gospel afresh, and enjoy God’s rest in Christ. He’s earned it.  \n\nWritten by Chris Martin\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nIt wasn’t a good mail day. I’d gotten a letter from the IRS saying that I owed money—a lot of money. And to make matters worse, the letter came with a warning: if I didn’t pay up within a couple of weeks, I’d get a stiff penalty. Honestly, the letter left me confused. I’d used a reputable accountant. I’d filed my return weeks before. What could have caused me to owe so much? I double-checked my records, and the mistake was obvious; I had filed the return, but I’d forgotten to mail the check. \n\nI can laugh about it now, but that letter produced a lot of anxiety at the time. I don’t look forward to warning letters. If I’m honest, I don’t really like warnings. They’re not always positive and encouraging, but they’re necessary. I’d rather be warned than incur a steep penalty. \n\nThe author of Hebrews invites us to hear a needed warning today. He reminds us how the human heart is bent toward evil. Like the Israelites who longed to go back to Egypt (Exodus 16:3,17:3), our sinful hearts can delude us into thinking we’re more secure apart from God than we are walking with Him. We’ve got to watch out and guard ourselves against an “evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God” (Hebrews 3:12). \n\nThis passage in Hebrews 3 also tells us that we need our friends, wives, and church leaders to step in daily to tell us when we’re headed in the wrong direction. We are human, which means we’re also sinners. We forget to mail checks on time; we lose our keys; and we sometimes lose our cool. Maybe it’s easy to speak up when it’s something small. But when I see a brother who’s slandering his pastor or putting down his wife behind her back, am I tempted to think, Well, that’s his business, and just walk away?\n\nHebrews doesn’t let me off the hook so easily. It instructs us to encourage one another daily, so we’re not hardened by sin’s deception (v.13). And as we caution one another, we also inspire confidence, believing that all who keep holding on to the reality Christ gives us at the start will share in His eternal rest at the end (v.14).\n\nThe time for giving and receiving these warnings and encouragements is now. We must speak up and warn one another before it’s too late. If you see me headed in the wrong direction on a one-way street, please honk your horn! I need a course correction because I’m headed for destruction. The direction of our souls requires this same level of urgency. As Paul writes elsewhere, “Now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!” (2 Corinthians 6:2). \n\nWritten by Jared Kennedy\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "\n\nA quote often attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson says, “Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” In many ways, this captures the essence of pioneering leadership. Those who have led through the unlikely and even seemingly impossible often stand out as examples of greatness among their peers.\n\nWhen you think of great leaders, who comes to mind? Most of us would think of a political leader or a CEO or a famous coach. There are plenty of good options to choose from. For an ancient Israelite, though, it would have been difficult to think of anyone greater than Moses. If you read through Exodus, you’ll understand why.\n\nGod used Moses to miraculously deliver Israel from Egyptian slavery, even though Moses initially showed reluctance based on his feelings of inadequacy to perform such a task. Moses wasn’t the greatest speaker. What were the odds that he, an Israelite, would be able to persuade Pharaoh, the god-king of Egypt to bend to his request? It seemed like an unlikely mission at best, and would certainly require divine intervention to succeed.\n\nGod did intervene. While Moses was the chosen human instrument through which God would act to bring His people out of slavery, ultimately it was God’s power that secured freedom for the Israelites. God demonstrates throughout the Bible that He is a great rescuer and redeemer. Redemption as a release from the slavery of sin is one of the most often used metaphors for salvation in Scripture. \n\nAs the book of Hebrews reminds us, all the key events in Scripture, like the exodus, and even the great leaders of God’s people, like Moses, point to someone much greater. In Hebrews, we are reminded that Jesus is much greater than Moses, and He led His people out of a slavery far worse than that which was imposed by Egypt; we had been held captive under the slavery of sin and death until Christ set us free.\n\nFor this reason, Jesus is the pioneer of our salvation, our redemptive forerunner and representative. He leads us out of slavery to sin and death toward a greater promised land, the presence of God. Jesus forged a new path; in fact, He is the new path. He says, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6), and calls us to trust Him and follow Him. \n\nThroughout the Bible, we are reminded again and again that God delivers His people. The book of Hebrews shows us that Jesus provides the ultimate deliverance the Scriptures have been pointing to all along. And so, we can say with the prophets and the writer of Hebrews, “Again, I will trust him” (2:13), knowing that “every one of God’s promises is ‘Yes’ in him” (2 Corinthians 1:20).\n\nWritten by Matt Capps\n\n                ",

After all, who in his right mind would want to sit as far away from the field as possible? I do, however, have an appreciation for the aerial shots of a televised football game. Such shots tend to put the biggest and strongest athletes in perspective—they’re still relatively small. \n\nIn Psalm 8, David—who seems to have had a keen eye for the book of nature, which was perhaps strengthened from his days as a shepherd—contrasted mankind with the majesty of the heavenly bodies: “When I observe your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you set in place, what is a human being that you remember him, a son of man that you look after him?” (vv.3–4).There is perhaps nothing so effective at reminding us of our insignificance as looking up at the starry skies. Both their vast distance away and their glory leave us awestruck. We are so small and insignificant by comparison.\n\nThough we are so much smaller, so much less glorious than the night sky, the psalmist, speaking of God’s assessment of man, goes on to say, “You made him little less than God and crowned him with glory and honor. You made him ruler over the works of your hands; you put everything under his feet” (vv.5–6). It is absolutely astonishing—even after the fall—the sorts of things God allows man to accomplish. We have built cities, developed amazing technologies, and even discovered cures for some diseases. These are, in small part, a picture of what it means for man to have dominion over creation.\n\nNevertheless, men still die in fires, while at sea, and occasionally even by wild animal attack. Since the  fall of Adam, man has not been able to fully exercise dominion over this world for the glory of God. The writer of Hebrews, picking up on the teaching of Psalm 8, puts it this way: “As it is, we do not yet see everything subjected to him” (Hebrews 2:8). He then adds, “But we do see Jesus—made lower than the angels for a short time so that by God’s grace he might taste death for everyone—crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death” (v.9). Though the kingdom of God has come, it is not yet fully here. Sin remains in the world, and our dominion is limited until Christ returns. \n\nIn the meantime, we wait with hope, looking to Jesus, the One who has already conquered sin and death. We know that when He returns, we will reign with Him for all eternity. That is our sure future. Our ultimate significance is found not in what we can accomplish in this life, but in our union with Christ now and forevermore.   \n\nWritten by Nick Batzig\n\n                ",

First, I love the poetry of the line. It’s a beautifully crafted statement and image—lyrical, ironic, forthright, and severe. The entire book is this way—filled with imagery, concepts, warnings, and encouragement that read like poetic meditations on glorious and fearful things.\n\nAlso, I love how the line frames the holiness of God and our need for redemption, another theme that runs throughout the book. This is a beautiful, powerful, sometimes terrifying book if you read it without humility, reverence, and a sense of awe before the Lord.\n\nBut if you read it with humble eyes and an open heart, you’ll find Hebrews fights for our hearts. It lifts our eyes up from our present struggles—and in the case of the original audience, from persecution—to consider the eternal glory and majesty of Christ and to find our hope there.\n\nThis letter was written to Christians with Jewish roots. They were being persecuted for their faith, and many were wondering if it was worth it to continue to claim the name of Christ. To these people facing these struggles, the author clearly says, “Long ago God spoke to the fathers by the prophets at different times and in different ways. In these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son. God has appointed him heir of all things and made the universe through him” (Hebrews 1:1–2).\n\nYou’ll notice as you read that the author threads this letter with dozens of references to the Old Testament. He does this to demonstrate that everything the Hebrew people’s forefathers believed in and hoped for has been fulfilled in Christ. And Christ will finish the saving work He began. Where else can they go? To what else can they cling?\n\nThe power and supremacy of Christ described in this letter would cause any of us to tremble in His presence. It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God. But to adapt a phrase from the disciple Peter, where else should we fall? He alone has the words of life. May the daily Scripture readings in this study plan challenge you, inspire you, correct you where needed, and deepen your confidence in God’s ability and resolve to rid the world of all evil and make all things new. \n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey\n\n                ",

		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nPhilemon has something you don’t often find in Scripture: some comedy. In verses 18–20, Paul takes on Onesimus’s debts. Whatever Onesimus might have owed Philemon is now Paul’s to repay. Here’s the comedy. Paul leaves it for Philemon to call that debt in with a question I’d paraphrase like this: “Onesimus’s debt is now mine, Philemon. I’ll repay it. But don’t forget, I gave you the gospel, so you owe me your life. In light of the fact that I’ve taken his debt and you owe me your life, tell me, how much do I owe you?” (vv.17–20).\n\nThat right there is funny. But it’s also rightly serious. Paul wants Philemon to do for Onesimus what Paul did for Philemon: set him free. Relationships are costly. If two people walk the same road together for any length of time at all, they will inevitably end up hurting one another at some point. Spouses, friends, folks at church—no one is exempt.\n\nFor love’s sake, Onesimus and Paul agreed that Onesimus needed to be reconciled to Philemon. As his drive to escape led Onesimus to flee 1,200 miles to get away from Philemon, his drive to be reconciled has now set him on a 1,200-mile return. But it wasn’t just Onesimus who needed to be set free. Paul would’ve been glad to keep him around, but they knew there is a debt they owe Philemon. They owe it to Philemon to invite him to receive Onesimus as a brother, to forgive whatever grievances he might be feeling too. They can’t withhold this opportunity from him.\n\nForgiveness is a work of liberation. Every one of us has, at one time or another, borne the pain of someone else’s anger, bitterness, or disappointment, just as we have taken others captive by our own. This is where forgiveness comes in. To forgive is not merely to dismiss an offense. It is to release someone, so that we might both live in freedom. Forgiveness is a fuel that spurs us forward. That’s how Paul characterizes the choice before Philemon. If Philemon forgives Onesimus, he will take him back no longer as a slave, but as a beloved brother. Not only is his past pardoned, but his future finds a renewed purpose.\n\nWho are you harming with your actions, emotions, or even lack of forgiveness? What would it look like for you to set them free? And how would it set you free? Forgiveness will cost you. It may cost you money or possessions. It may cost you even more, maybe your image and reputation. And it may even open up an entire underworld of unforgiveness locked deep inside your heart.\n\nBut by God’s grace, the act of forgiveness might draw you into a place where you have to wrestle with what you truly believe about the forgiveness of Christ, and you may begin to see traces of His presence you’ve never noticed before. Embrace the work of Christ in your life and in the lives of others. Forgive where there are offenses. Love each other in a future-bound direction. Grant to others a generous spirit that says, “Yes, brother, may I benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ” (v.20).\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

		"devo_title": "Philemon’s Love and Faith",
		"devo_summary": "By Barnabas Piper\n\nThe word “always” is rarely an accurate term. Most absolutes are exaggerations, so when a writer of the Bible uses “always” we should sit up and take notice. Something so sweeping and so totally complete is not to be overlooked or downplayed. The Bible does not misspeak or overplay its hand. So, when Paul says, “I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers” (Philemon 1:4), it is significant.\n\nHe could have said “I pray for you often” or even “I’m thankful for you,” but he went with “always.” Why? What moved Paul to such a heightened level of gratitude for Philemon? The following verses tell us: “I hear of your love for all the saints and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus” (v.5). Paul goes on to write of his “great joy and encouragement” from Philemon’s love and how his faith has refreshed the hearts of other believers (v.7).\n\nPhilemon was someone Paul was grateful for, but so were many Christians and leaders of churches Paul wrote to. So why this effusive thanks? Philippians 1 offers further explanation because Paul says something similar there: “I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you.” Why? “Because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now… I have you in my heart, and you are all partners with me in grace” (Philippians 1:3–5,7).\n\nWhat moves Paul’s heart is the unique unity and love that is only found through Christ, a profound bond defined by the gospel. It is not merely working for the same cause or having fond feelings. It is a supernatural oneness in Christ. In Colossians, Paul longs for the “hearts [of believers] to be encouraged and joined together in love, so that they may have all the riches of complete understanding and have the knowledge of God’s mystery—Christ” (Colossians 2:2). In Philemon, he speaks more personally to the man himself, lauding his love and expressing a desire to see his “participation in the faith… become effective” (Philemon 1:6).\n\nWe see the love of brothers in the faith who are also partners on a mission. The affection is not passive but pushes the recipient more and more toward Jesus and toward holiness. The growth in holiness elicits more love and affection. In writing these words to Philemon, Paul is pressing him onward in love and faith. It is not cheap praise, but rather identifies him as a true partner, brother, and minister. This is especially important given the difficult and sensitive request Paul makes of Philemon later in the letter.\n\nMost of all, what we should see in these words is the centrality of Christ. It is Philemon’s love of Christ that causes Paul’s gratitude to overflow. And so, Paul prays that Philemon’s faith would grow even more, further glorifying Christ. This is a supernatural affection, something outside of human norms, and Paul is emphasizing it so that every challenging word that follows will be rooted in love and in Christ.",

		"devo_summary": "By Caleb Faires\n\nWe recently acquired a second dog, and I’ve been on puppy duty in the mornings. This dog is a Great Dane, which means she’s a rather big puppy. She likes to get up at 4:30 in the morning and chase the cat through the house, barge through doors to wake the children, or chew on things she’s not supposed to, like the kitchen table. I remember a time not so long ago, when I could wake just before sunrise, get a cup of coffee, read the psalms, and pray—uninterrupted.\n\nWhen things get hectic, it’s easy to blame the circumstances of the day for disruptions to our prayer lives. But of course, there are always ready excuses if we’re looking for them. I can blame my pets, my children, the load of work that awaits me at the office today, or my exhaustion from the day before. But regardless, Scripture exhorts us not only to pray, but to be devoted to prayer. This is why Paul writes: “Devote yourselves to prayer, stay alert in it with thanksgiving” (Colossians 4:2). He then urges the Colossians to ask God to bless his ministry, offers several exhortations on Christian living, and issues a series of personal greetings.\n\nI am struck, here, by Paul’s list of friends in ministry. First, is Tychicus, a faithful encourager of the flock, as well as a friend and advocate for Onesimus (Ephesians 6:21–22; Philemon 1:9–10,17). Onesimus was once an unbelieving runaway slave, before becoming Paul’s faithful and dearly loved brother in the faith (Philemon 1). Aristarchus was a missionary companion and shared in Paul’s imprisonment (Colossians 4:10). John Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, was once an unreliable missionary who abandoned Paul halfway through a missionary journey; however, he went on to become a trusted fellow worker with Paul (v.10). Jesus, who is called Justus, was a Jewish convert who aided in Paul’s ministry to the Gentiles (v.11). In addition, Paul warmly greets Epaphras, the prayer warrior, Luke, the physician and gospel writer, and Demas, who shared in Paul’s first imprisonment (vv.12–14).\n\nWhat strikes me about this list is the testimony it is to the overflow of God’s grace. These men, each a comfort to Paul, were all shaped by grace, transformed by prayer, and now stood as ebenezers of thanksgiving.\n\nWhy are we to devote ourselves to prayer and thanksgiving? Because every gift of heaven is of the grace of the Father (James 1:17). He fulfills the desires of all who call on Him (Psalm 145:19). There is no excuse to not pray. If we truly glimpse the wonder of His grace in our lives, and hunger for more, there will not be enough Great Dane puppies, full inboxes, unfinished baseboards, or late-night exhaustion to keep us from running to the mercy seat, where He hears us. The fullness of our fellowship with God, and the richness of fellowship with our fellow believers is inextricably tied to our devotion to prayer and thanksgiving. With Paul, I pray, “Grace be with you.” And I hope that you also will pray for me, as we each partake in the good work of the kingdom.",

		"devo_summary": "By Chris Martin\n\nI’ve worked in Christian publishing my whole career, an industry I’d never planned to enter when I was working on my Bible degree in college, preparing to pastor a church. Over the course of my career, one of my favorite jobs gave me the opportunity to help authors improve their online writing and social media strategy. Some writers are reluctant to self-promote their work online, so part of my job was to help reframe social media for them; the more effective their online presence, the better they can share the gifts God has given them in their writing—not in an effort to become more famous or get more attention, but to serve more readers.\n\nWe are called to do all we do for the glory of God, not the praise of men or promotion of ourselves. In today’s reading from Colossians, Paul writes to a few different groups of people: wives and husbands, children and their parents, slaves and masters. The heart of Paul’s message to all of these people is this: “Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and not for people” (Colossians 3:23). Ultimately, everything we do is for God, not other people. Not even for ourselves. This is paired with the call in Scripture to consider our interactions with other people. God’s Word “has told each of [us] what is good and what it is the LORD requires of [us]: to act justly, to love faithfulness, and to walk humbly with [our] God” (Micah 6:8).\n\nHowever, Paul’s instruction to the Colossians, which was meant to be taken within the context of familial or household relationships, indicates that our relationships with others have not only horizontal implications (with other people), but they also have vertical implications (with God). Every relationship we have—with our wives, our kids, our parents, our bosses, our friends, our acquaintances, and even strangers—is meant to revolve around our relationship with the Lord.\n\nSo, when we discipline our children, we do so in the presence of God and for His glory. When we attend a boring work meeting, we do so in the presence of God and for His glory. When we take our ailing parents to their doctor appointments, we do so in the presence of God and for His glory. We are called to submit to one another in love out of reverence for our God who is love (Ephesians 5:21). But we can’t do this in our own strength; we need God, who is love, to work in us and through us to love and honor others in His name (1John 4:16). It is only through Him who first loved us that we are able to love others (v.19). Whatever we do, Paul says, ought to be from the heart and for the Lord, not just for our own good or the good of those around us.",

The alloys and tolerances and energy densities that make your car go are understood down to the molecular level. It is a fully reproducible product.\n\nWe sometimes approach Christianity the same way. Creeds, solas, key verses, three-point sermons—though these can be helpful tools, they all lack something because they are intentional simplifications. Unlike a car engine, the Christian life can’t be manufactured in pieces and put together on an assembly line. Instead, it is living and active like the Savior we follow and the Holy Spirit who dwells in us as believers. We don’t find flow charts or schematics in Scripture; we find stories, guidance, and teaching. As we follow after Jesus, our understanding deepens and we are changed by God Himself.\n\nJesus, before He raised Lazarus from the dead, told Martha, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live” (John 11:25). Believers are united with Christ in His death and resurrection. The condemnation of us in sin died with Him. “My sin not in part, but the whole, is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more,” as the hymn goes—not in pieces, with some residual bits left on the floor, but all of my sin has been put to death by Jesus.\n\nIn Colossians, we are instructed to put to death the remnants that belong to that condemned life. Because that death to our old self on the cross is just as real as Christ’s death, stinking and bound in grave clothes. And the new life we find in Him is as real as His own resurrection.\n\nIn Christ, we are offered a whole life of being renewed by the Holy Spirit and made into the image of our Creator, putting on a new self that is marked by the compassion, humility, and peace of Christ. The grave clothes we once wore have been replaced with new clothes—qualities gifted and equipped by the Spirit to match this new life in Him. Above all, we are called to put on love because He first loved us (Colossians 3:14). This love that we experience in Him is what equips us to love and encourage one another as the word of Christ dwells in us completely (v.16).\n\nWe can learn about this love, this second life we’ve been given in Christ, through the different tools of our faith traditions. But it cannot be systematized or quantified to the point that we replicate it; we can’t mass produce the Christian life from a formula. We learn the depth of this love and this life through daily living out our walk as disciples of Jesus, raised to walk in new life in Him.",

		"devo_summary": "By Jeremy Writebol\n\nHe could never do enough. The young man was convinced that he could finally be accepted and loved if he strictly disciplined himself and followed all the rules. To use his own words, “I wearied myself greatly for almost fifteen years with the daily sacrifice, tortured myself with fastings, vigils, prayers, and other very rigorous works. I earnestly thought to acquire righteousness by my works.” Martin Luther, the famous German theologian, believed the lie that severe self-discipline, even to the point of self-harm, would make a person spiritually acceptable before God.\n\nHe wasn’t the first or the last to believe the lie either.\n\nA deep concern of the apostle Paul for his friends in the community of Colossae is that they would believe the lie as well. Certain false teachers had told them that true spirituality was found in either strict legalism—including obeying specific Jewish eating and drinking customs—or in deep mystical experiences. They claimed those who refrained from eating certain foods or those who claimed to have visions of angels in the spiritual realm were truly spiritual. If that wasn’t you, then you weren’t part of the spiritual community.\n\nBut true spirituality has never been centered around what you avoid eating or drinking, or what out-of-body experiences you’ve had. Paul points out to his friends that they were united to Christ. They don’t have to have mystical experiences or sit under legalistic expectations to be accepted by God. These things were nothing more than “self-made religion” and “false humility” (Colossians 2:23). These regulations were merely “human commands and doctrines” (v.22).\n\nSadly, this lie persists today. Wherever we find the spiritual maturity of believers is measured by our own efforts, whether dietary laws and customs or experiential events and activities, you’ll find those believers have bought into a lie. Our salvation is measured on the basis of what Christ has done for us. This is the truth that Martin Luther embraced, as he abandoned the lie of self-righteousness. We are accepted because of Jesus’s work, not our own. Our spiritual maturity is found in the Holy Spirit, who empowers us to defeat our sinful passions and produces fruit in us (Romans 14:17–18).\n\nSometimes, we don’t even realize that we’ve bought into the lie. Before we know it, we’ve measured our spiritual growth, and even the maturity of other Christians, by unbiblical standards. Reject those lies! Christ died to free us so that we will live our lives in response to Him, not under the weight of false teaching. Let’s lean into the freeing joy of a Christian life that is lived in response to embracing the truth: we are accepted because of God’s love for us in Christ Jesus.",

We lived in a town with lots of scenic country roads, many of which have bike lanes. So, I did what any sensible person would do to guarantee success in my new endeavor. I bought a bike, upgraded pedals, cycling shoes, stretchy pants, and even a vintage cycling jersey to raise the cool factor. So there I was, decked out and ready to begin my adventures as an avid cyclist. I met up with one of my cycling friends, and hit the road—once.\n\nHas this ever happened to you? We’re often sold on the idea that having the special gadget, the newest equipment, the right five-step plan, or the latest diet will somehow transform us from the people we are into the people we want to be. What is true for the outer man is true for the inner man as well. We are tempted by insider knowledge, trade secrets, and all the latest gnostic short-cuts that promise us fulfillment.\n\nBut Paul warns us to not be taken captive by such worldly deceit. Human wisdom and philosophy is so palatable to our taste that if we are not on our guard, it can truly take us captive. It always falls short and leaves us empty.  While Paul might have easily focused on all the dismal results of trusting in false hopes and foolish philosophies, he instead directs us to the abundant richness of Christ. Indeed, Christ Himself is the answer to every hope and aspiration of the human heart.\n\nNot only this, but this very Word that was made flesh and dwelt among us now fills us by His Spirit. “The entire fullness of God’s nature dwells bodily in Christ” (Colossians 2:9). Christ, who is God Himself, is ours. If ever there was any aspiration of the human heart, its true answer is found in Christ. In Him, we are purified, freed from bondage to sin and from all its obligations. In Him, we are raised to new life, no longer bound to the futility of death that we inherited from Adam. In Him, we are made new.\n\nThe world will always be busy about offering new-hatched solutions and ear-tickling ideas based on the elements of this world, but it is all dust and ashes. The truth is this: we have more than all we need in Christ, who alone has triumphed over the rulers and authorities of earth, who alone buries our sin and raises us up with Him. The vain offerings of this world lose all their luster because we have been given all things in Christ. Thanks be to God!",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nMy three children attend the school where my wife and I teach. Our whole family has had the unique opportunity to spend our waking hours on the same campus. If any of them need me, I can be by their side in a matter of minutes. Admittedly, we’re spoiled by our proximity to each other. But we’re about to experience a seismic shift in our circumstances. Our oldest is in 6th grade, which means this is her last year at our school. Soon, we’ll have to bring her to a different campus and leave her in the care of others.\n\nI often contemplate whether we’ve done enough as her parents. Have we taught her everything she needs to know about our crazy world? Have we told her often enough that she’s smart, beautiful, and kind? At the heart of all my questioning is this: Can my little girl make it without me? Even if our specific circumstances are fairly unique, all parents understand the central challenge of letting go.\n\nPaul seems to really love his friends in Colossae. Certainly, he wanted what was best for them, as evidenced by the letters he wrote to them; the very existence of those letters is evidence that Paul could not remain with them forever. At some point, Paul had to let go and let them live out their faith apart from his direct influence and in spite of his absence. Perhaps he lost sleep, wondering if they would make it on their own. Maybe he shed tears for the believers when he learned of their being persuaded to follow bad teaching about Jesus.\n\nBut we see in his letter to the Colossians that his fears were stilled by his confidence in the Lord. Paul was able to trust that the Holy Spirit would faithfully attend to the work that had begun in the hearts and minds of Paul’s friends. He was able to let them work out their own faith with the assurance that “in [Jesus] are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Colossians 2:3).\n\nI read these passages and find solace. Truly, my daughter has everything she needs to tend the garden of faith the Lord has planted within her heart. Her well-being does not ultimately depend on whatever I did or didn’t do well. The strength of her commitment to Jesus will not be a function of whatever I failed to do. Her ability to navigate the world will be determined by the fact that she is firmly rooted in the one who is perfectly faithful, mighty to save, and unflinchingly committed to those He has called. When it’s time to let my little girl go, I must remember that all the wisdom and understanding she needs rests powerfully in the name of Jesus, the lover of her soul.",

		"devo_summary": "By Collin Ross\n\nI had a roommate in college who made the most impressive sandwiches. While I settled for simple meat and cheese, there wasn’t much in the fridge that he left behind. I’m convinced that Paul would’ve liked my roommate. When he writes this hymn to Christ from today’s reading, there are few accolades left on the shelf after his repository of praise. Paul uses language from a wide variety of biblical themes to communicate the preeminence of Jesus, making it nearly impossible to walk away with the inclination that Jesus is due a mere hour of praise each week in a church service. No, He is worth the full weight of our lives and our unshifting attention.\n\nThe church in Colossae was experiencing pressure to compromise in their faith. In his letter to them, Paul begins with an emphatic statement of the importance and centrality of Christ in everything. The hymn can be broken down into two stanzas: the first, proclaiming Christ’s kingship over all creation (Colossians 1:15–17), and the second, over all of new creation (vv.18–20).\n\nWhile we are made in the image of God in order that we might reflect His glory on earth, Jesus is the true image of God (Colossians 1:15). In Him, the character and purposes of God are not merely reflected, but embodied in full. It’s the difference between marveling at a picture of the Grand Canyon and standing awestruck on the edge of the real thing. “He is the firstborn over all creation,” which was created by Him, through Him, and for Him; He is both the author and king of our world (vv.15–16; 1Corinthians 8:6).\n\nBut Paul is quick to point out that Christ is also Lord of a new creation that He himself is bringing into existence. He is the head of a new body, a new community that gathers around and identifies with His way of life. His resurrection life is the precursor to theirs, for “he is the firstborn from the dead” (Colossians 1:18). The same fullness of God’s glory that once filled the tabernacle (Exodus 40:34) is also found in Christ. Where once it was in the temple that God’s people found reconciliation, today it is found in Jesus, who has brought us peace with God “through [His] blood, shed on the cross” (Colossians 1:20). We also have “the knowledge of [Christ’s] will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding” through the work of the Holy Spirit in us, “so that [we] may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work” (vv.9–10).\n\nWhat a rich hymn! So why does Paul open the firehose of descriptors for Jesus at the onset of this letter to the Colossians? To encourage them not to turn away from their Creator, King, and Redeemer. Like many of us, these first-century believers were facing immense pressure to turn their backs on Jesus and compromise in their convictions. But as we remind ourselves of the true and glorious nature of our Lord, revealed through His loving sacrifice for us, our inclination to turn away fades and our love for Christ grows brighter.",

		"devo_title": "Thanksgiving",
		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nPaul opens his letter to the Colossians by articulating his thanks to God for their existence. Now, we could read this as a standard greeting, as if it were just another way to say hello. Or we could take Paul’s words at face value and ask, why does Paul open this letter with thanksgiving? Well, as we will see, he is thankful because Jesus changes people.\n\nBear with me and allow me to connect a few dots about this letter’s origin and connection to Philemon, the second of Paul’s letters we will read together in this study. The two letters were likely delivered together to the church in Colossae. In Colossians 4:7, we find that Tychicus delivered this letter to the Colossian church. Two verses later, we’re told that Onesimus, the runaway slave from Colossae who we will read more about in Paul’s letter to Philemon, also accompanied Tychicus on his letter-carrying journey (Colossians 4:9). Then, in the opening verses of Philemon, we discover that the church in Onesimus’s hometown of Colossae met in Philemon’s house, and that Onesimus was there with Tychicus when these letters were delivered.\n\nWhat does all this mean? It means Philemon was one of the leaders at the church in Colossae because the church met in his house. When Tychicus stepped into the church in Colossae to deliver this letter, he was actually standing in Philemon’s home. And right there beside him stood Onesimus, Philemon’s runaway slave who had come back for the purpose of seeking reconciliation with him. There would’ve been no notice of their arrival beforehand, just the sight of them standing there, letters in hand.\n\nThink about that for a minute. Paul’s letters to the Colossians and Philemon were delivered to Philemon’s home by Tychicus and Onesimus, Philemon’s former slave who had come to Christ and was now the spiritual brother to his former master. That, friends, is the dizzying, beautiful, unfolding drama of redemption. Is it any wonder then that Paul opens this letter with a word of thanksgiving for God’s ability to change people?\n\nAs you read this letter, you’ll see how Paul celebrates the transforming grace of Christ and how it truly takes us from being separated from our Maker to being united to Him. Paul dives into the deep waters of the redemption and Lordship of Jesus. He gets heady, theological, and precise—all important things for us to get our heads and hearts around.\n\nBut perhaps it will serve your reading of Paul’s opening words of thanks, for the transforming grace and work of Jesus, with that image of Onesimus, standing in Philemon’s door next to Tychicus, with these letters in hand. It sure does for me.",

I have vivid memories of lacing up the rental skates and inching my way to the rink. It started the same way every time. At first, I was a wobbly mess, unsteady on my feet, taking that awkward, slow first lap. But after a while I got used to the skates and started zipping around like a pro.\n\nBut then came the weirdest part of all: returning the skates and slipping on my sneakers. Moments earlier I’d been gliding across the room with confidence and grace, three inches off the ground. Being back in my street shoes, suddenly pinned to the earth, left me feeling like I was meant to float above it.\n\nWe were meant for the kingdom of God in all its fullness. We feel the ache of the limitations of this life, and Scripture tells us that’s because we were made to experience the fullness of another kingdom.\n\nRevelation 22 tells us that Jesus is coming again, and soon. When we go back to the beginning of the Bible, the first few chapters (Genesis 1–3), we find God at work creating everything we know, and calling it all “good.” We see Him make people in His image, and we see humanity rebel against Him. Then we hear the clink of the flaming swords of Eden as our first parents are cast from the garden. What follows through the rest of the Old Testament and into the New is an ongoing struggle between God and His rebellious people. Will we ever be reconciled? Will that reconciliation be the kind that lasts? Revelation 22 answers with a resounding yes.\n\nWhat does God’s reconciling work in Christ look like? Scripture reassures us that God’s eternal plan for His people is one of relational intimacy. We are not merely tolerated by God. We’re loved. We’re kept. We will live in an ongoing eternal relationship with Him.\n\nIn this life, we practice the life to come by seeking to live according to the Word of our God who does not change. We practice living in a kingdom that will be forever ours. When we worship, pray, study Scripture, and participate in the local church, it’s like we’re lacing up our skates and practicing for the day when we’ll live in the fullness of His kingdom. We’re getting a taste of the deeper satisfaction and gliding grace our hearts were made to know.\n\nWe are called to persevere in obedience and live in light of the reality that Jesus is coming back, knowing that when He does, it will be as a groom coming for His bride. And all will be well. Forever. It’s a freedom we’ll never again have to exchange for these old street shoes.\n\n“Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!” (Revelation 22:20).\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nOur King calls us to share in His kingdom work and participate in its growth.\n\nFor the longest time, I understood the parable of the mustard seed to be exclusively about faith. The only message I took to heart was the idea that even with faith the size of a mustard seed, I could move mountains.\n\nRecently, however, I stumbled onto something that broadened my perspective on this earthy illustration used by Jesus, and suddenly, the eyes of my heart were turned outward. While the “faith = mustard seed” part of the equation is featured in Matthew 17:20, four chapters earlier Jesus issues a different comparison: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field” (Matthew 13:31).\n\nThe “mustard seed,” it turns out, is not just about my own life; it’s about God’s kingdom. I am one part of a larger mechanism: namely, the “one body” Paul alluded to in Ephesians 4:4. God calls us to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19–20). He also calls us to wait patiently for the Lord’s coming (James 5:7), conducting ourselves as those who’ve been set apart to live differently within the broader culture (1Peter 2:9).\n\nMy faith, however small and susceptible to skepticism and occasional spiritual malaise, was not given to me solely to save my soul, and certainly not just to keep me feeling warm and fuzzy about myself. It may accomplish these things, but the faith I was granted has been intended since before the foundation of the world to play a role in the unfolding of God’s plan to redeem humankind (Ephesians 1:4–5).\n\nI would do well to remember this passage, especially on days when I feel ill-equipped or underqualified to make any meaningful impact on the world. When I think of the kingdom as something that starts small but grows into something significant, I am reinvigorated with hope that I don’t have to have a bunch of advanced degrees, I don’t need to be a published author or a sought-after public speaker, and I don’t have to become an icon of Christian culture in order to play a meaningful role in God’s work. I just need to tend faithfully to the “plot of land,” however small, God has bequeathed to me and watch as He, the Master Gardener, brings to fruit all He has ordained for my life as His son.\n\nSo, if you don’t consider yourself remarkable enough, if you deem yourself to be a person of little consequence with no idea of how to go about using your modest faith to help grow God’s agenda—remember Matthew 13:31. It turns out, we don’t have to be born with an iron plow in our hands in order to be worthy participants in God’s sowing and subsequent harvest. Whatever little faith we have is all we need to be significant contributors to the advancement of God’s kingdom. Even I, as simple as I am, can participate in the flourishing of the garden God is actively restoring. Even a small deposit of faith can generate growth for the kingdom.\n\nWritten by Alex Florez",

Submitting to Christ as King is an act of worship.\n\nDr. Kent Brantly earned an undergraduate degree in biblical literature from Abilene Christian University in 2003. He then went on to earn his medical degree from Indiana University School of Medicine in 2009, after completing his residency in maternal-child health at a hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. He and his family then moved to Monrovia, Liberia, to serve with World Medical Mission, the medical missionary arm of Samaritan’s Purse. While treating patients of the Ebola virus in 2014, he contracted the deadly virus himself, and was then evacuated to Emory University Hospital where he recovered. Five years later, he returned with his family to Africa, this time to work in Zambia.   \n\nNow, not everyone is called overseas; there are certainly fine doctors and professionals of all kinds who serve God with their gifts wherever they are. But as I consider what it means to live as a citizen of God’s kingdom in my everyday life, Dr. Kent Brantly is a source of inspiration. His obedience to Christ led him to deny himself at great expense, almost costing him his life.\n\nJesus tells us in Luke 9:23, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me.” Our default setting is to do whatever is best for ourselves. Sin most often leads us to take the easiest route, the path of least resistance. Faithful obedience calls us to a higher standard; we are to put God and His kingdom before ourselves and our selfish pursuits.\n\nOnly a fool would deny himself if this life were all we have. But we know that our lives are much more than this 80-to-90-year existence we experience on earth. To deny ourselves today and tomorrow and the next day is to invest in a kingdom that is forever. God in Christ calls us to come and die so that we may live! What a glorious trade to give up ourselves in this short life to experience the fullness of life and beauty.\n\nIn what ways might we take up our crosses and deny ourselves every day? Perhaps one of the easiest ways to practice this would be to make time with the Lord a priority above anything else we may want to do. Do you spend time in Scripture or in prayer before you watch television or play video games? What does it say about our priorities if we always find time to go hang out with the guys, but we can’t find time to serve at church? The denial of self is unnatural because righteousness and obedience are unnatural. We must rely on the Holy Spirit to convict us and turn our hearts toward the Savior we worship.\n\nWritten by Chris Martin",

And they love going. We all look forward to it for weeks. The only thing our children have to do to prepare for a vacation is get in the van on the appointed morning. But my wife and I spend hours planning, packing, reserving, scheduling, rescheduling, and trying to locate everyone’s sunglasses. This is how I anticipate a beach trip for our family of eight. When we anticipate something important, whether it is a family vacation, a wedding, or Christmas morning, we get ready. Our waiting isn’t passive, but preparatory. We wait, not just with expectation, but with longing.\n\nWe find this same sense of anticipation in the parable of the ten virgins. It is, after all, a party parable. Jesus is saying to us that His kingdom isn’t just some nifty way to dodge the final judgment; it is a more glorious celebration than we can imagine. It is the party of all eternity, the marriage supper of the Lamb, the coming of the great and glorious bridegroom, and the only party that truly matters. This certainly merits readiness, preparation, and anticipation.\n\nThere is, of course, a note of peril in this parable. God has invited us to the great banquet, and we know that we ought to “make every effort” to be there on time: oil in reserve and lamps trimmed (2Peter 3:14). But we are also highly distractible and notorious procrastinators. When we await the coming kingdom, we aren’t to be idly twiddling our thumbs with nonchalant indifference. No. We are to be actively engaged in seeking the kingdom, listening eagerly for the sound of the trumpet, because this is the very thing we have been hoping for all our lives.\n\nAs Matthew Henry observed, “Those are wise or foolish indeed, that are so in the affairs of their souls.” Is there oil in your lamp? An eternal wedding feast for eternal souls is not to be handled lightly. So, we wait for our Savior, keeping our hearts tuned, our ears sharp, and minds turned to Him. While we wait for Christ’s return, the Spirit equips us to live faithfully in light of our redemption in Christ, provoking us through His Word to be watchful. Indeed, the whole thrust of the Christian life begins at the cross and moves toward the return of Christ in glory. In our own strength, we fall far short. Like all ten of the virgins, or even like the disciples in the garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36–46), we are likely to doze off. Our eager waiting and anticipation are “based on His promise,” on His own power to fulfill, His own Spirit to seal and equip us (2Peter 3:13). May we be found ready on the day of His coming!\n\nWritten by Caleb Faires",

		"devo_summary": "By Collin Ross\n\nJesus describes what it means to enter the kingdom.\n\nThe kingdom of God is often discussed as if it were an amusement park with an impossibly high admission fee. Humanity could never pay the fee to gain entrance, so Jesus came to pay it for us. Now, thanks to Jesus, we have received the ticket to all the “attractions” of the kingdom!\n\nThe problem with this line of thinking is how it turns disciples of Jesus into mere consumers of God’s kingdom, forgetting the meaning of Christ’s resurrection, ascension, and sending of the Spirit. Rather, the complete story of the gospel leaves no room for passive consumption of kingdom blessings. It demands active participation.\n\nA better analogy would be to liken the kingdom to a breathtaking dance or choreography with impossibly difficult moves. Humanity could never twist and turn its body in such beautiful motions, so Jesus came to give us new bodies that could. Now, thanks to Jesus, we can take part in the kingdom dance of God. Do you see the difference? We are participants, not consumers.\n\nThis is surely what Jesus is teaching His disciples at the end of His Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7). Having described at length what kingdom life looks like, He pivots to clarify how we can join in on His kingdom dance. Notice how each section revolves around movement: entering through a narrow gate and walking on a difficult road (Matthew 7:13–14), growing good fruit (vv.15–20), and doing the Father’s will (vv.21–23). But it is important that we interpret His requirements for kingdom-entry while keeping in mind the task that Jesus came to accomplish.\n\nTake, for example, Christ’s teaching that “every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit” (Matthew 7:17). He’s differentiating between those who are a part of His kingdom and those who are not. Christ says the same in His parable of the wheat and the weeds (Matthew 13:24–30). According to Jesus, those who have entered the kingdom are the ones who are producing “good fruit,” meaning their lives are furthering the restorative mission of God in the world.\n\nIs it safe, then, to say that following Jesus in God’s kingdom is about how we live? Well, yes, but Jesus’s explanation of His own parable complicates matters. When asked to explain the parable of the wheat and weeds, the very first thing Christ says is, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man” (Matthew 13:37). It is Jesus, the Son of Man, who causes the wheat to grow and produce the good fruit of the kingdom. Our participation in the kingdom is the direct result of Christ’s work of renewal in us.\n\nThis is the way the scriptures describe how we enter God’s kingdom. It is a cooperation of both heaven and earth as they move in sync with one another. By Christ’s saving work and the Spirit’s presence, we are utterly transformed from the inside out. As a result, we are free to align ourselves with God’s redemptive mission, and as we do, we join His kingdom-dance.\n\nWritten by Collin Ross",

		"devo_summary": "By Chris Martin\n\nOur priority is to seek the kingdom over earthly possessions, replacing worry with trust in God’s provision.\n\nWhen I was a senior in high school, my dad lost his job because of the recession. He had spent twenty-seven years—his entire professional career—with a large, reliable computer company. Then, like countless others, he lost his job. I had just committed to a private school that cost a lot of money, so my anxiety was high, and I was concerned that my college decision had just put our family in a poor financial situation. I was forced to grapple with anxiety revolving around money for the first time in my life. We were fortunate to not experience as dire circumstances as others did, to be sure, but it required me to trust the Lord in a way I never had to before.\n\nOne of the passages I ran to for comfort in those times, and have gone to many times since, is where we find Jesus talking about earthly possessions in His Sermon on the Mount. He says, “Don’t store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves don’t break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Matthew 6:19–21).\n\nIf we are blessed to spend eighty to ninety years on this earth, we will experience a full length of life. And yet, even those eight or nine decades of life are just a speck on the timeline of our true lives. We are all eternal beings, and yet the trinkets and dollar bills we collect in our pockets and piggy banks are left behind when we move on to the rest of our eternal lives. This reality can be either freeing or frightening, depending on where you find your value. But Jesus could not have been more clear: treasures in heaven are more worthy of our time and pursuit than treasures of earth. This is only logical, isn’t it? If we believe in eternity, isn’t it more valuable to stock up and invest in eternal wealth, rather than in this relatively short life on earth?\n\nThroughout our lives, we will all face decisions that require us to determine our priorities and what we value the most. Sometimes, we will have to decide between faithful obedience and the accrual of wealth. Maybe our bosses will ask us to do something unethical to earn a raise. Whatever it is, many of us will likely have more than one opportunity to decide whether we care more about investing in the kingdom of God or lining our own wallet.\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the road with regard to our faith in the kingdom of God: do we believe the kingdom is truly eternal? And is the kingdom more worthy of our lives—our time, attention, resources, and focus—than whatever wealth this temporary world offers us?",

Before I ate it, I had a “Millennial moment” and grabbed my camera, but I wasn’t happy with the picture. So, I started arranging things. I picked a little bit of shredded carrot off the cucumbers. Then, I stacked those in a neat little staircase. I arranged the purple onions on the other side of the cucumbers. I turned over the egg-slices so that the bright, yellow yolks popped. The croutons piled up right in the middle and I added some coarse, black pepper for contrast. I got a great picture, then I stirred it all together and ate it.\n\nI had compound motivations. It wasn’t enough for me just to have good food to eat. I wanted it to be seen by other people. It’s like that for all of us for many of the things we do. Many of my prayers are not prayers for their own sake, but prayers prompted by discomfort and frustration. At my worst, I want to parley with God; I offer Him the prayer and hope He gives me what I want. My giving is the same way. At best, I just like the good feeling I have when I help somebody. My motivations, on their own, often do not line up with God’s will. Instead, I feel like I give something up—my time, money, a meal—because I live as though that’s how you bank spiritual points.\n\nJesus teaches how I am wrong about this. Imagine a simple, pure pleasure. Sitting in a gentle breeze watching the sunset, a cold glass of water on a hot day—the things you don’t need any reason to do, but for the sheer satisfaction they offer within themselves. Suppose watching that sunset cost you the chance to pour over spreadsheets in a stuffy basement office. Is that really a cost? Would you ever think that not drinking that glass of water cost you the chance to be sweaty and grimy in the sun?\n\nPeter, James, and John decided that prayer in the garden would cost them some sleep. I have no doubt they looked back with remorse at the missed opportunity to pray with their Savior in His agony. As he watched the crucifixion the next day with Jesus’s mother, I can’t imagine John thinking, At least I caught that nap last night.\n\nIt is our own sin that tells us there is too great a cost, that the gift of God Himself isn’t enough. These acts of following Jesus—prayer, fasting, generosity—are means of worship. And worshiping God is its own reward. Our Father, “who sees in secret will reward [us].”",

		"devo_title": "The Law of the Kingdom",
		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nOur relationship to the Old Testament law is changed in Jesus, who fulfills the law and clarifies the ethics that characterize the kingdom.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I attended church with the owner of a local fast food restaurant. The back of the church bulletin had a coupon for a “buy one get one free” breakfast sandwich, “one per customer, per visit.” Dad used to make sure each member of our family got a bulletin. After church, we’d head straight for the restaurant, and Dad would give us each two dollars. Then we’d go through the line individually, so we could load up on free breakfast sandwiches. That’s what you call a loophole. \n\nPeople look for all kinds of loopholes—legal, ethical, financial, even spiritual. In today’s section of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus takes away our loopholes by talking about the Law, and what it really means in the kingdom of God.\n\nIn the Old Testament, the law came in two basic categories: moral and ceremonial. The moral law defines righteous living and tells us how to live in a way that is just, loving, and responsible with the time we’ve been given. The Ten Commandments, for example, are moral law. Jesus did not abolish this Law. Rather, He fulfilled it completely. \n\nThe ceremonial law, on the other hand, was given so that God’s people might be reminded that they were, in fact, bound to Him in a covenant relationship, and so that they could demonstrate this to other nations. This law included things like feasts, circumcision, holy day regulations, and the like. It was given to remind the Jewish people of their special union with God, one that no other nation shared. \n\nOur relationship to the Old Testament Law has changed in Jesus, who fulfilled it and clarified the ethics that characterize God’s kingdom. Christ’s birth nullified the ceremonial law. Believers would no longer have to worship on a specific hill in Jerusalem, but in Spirit and in truth. New believers would not need to be circumcised. God’s people could forego the kosher diet and eat all the bacon they wanted. Not too shabby.\n\nAs for the moral law, Jesus kept it perfectly. And He did it for us. He lived the life we were meant to live and then died the death we transgressors deserved, since “the wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). He lived in our place and died in our place, taking our record of sin and placing it upon Himself, and robing us in His perfect record of righteousness. That’s what Jesus meant when He said He didn’t come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it completely, for us (Matthew 5:17).\n\nI remember feeling all kinds of nervous as I stood in that line to get those breakfast sandwiches because I knew I was exploiting the intent of the coupon by way of a loophole. It is a mercy that we’re not left to find and exploit loopholes in God’s law in order to be saved. Our guilt is removed. Jesus has fulfilled the law perfectly on our behalf.",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nThe upside-down nature of the kingdom reframes our understanding of human struggles.\n\nSince becoming a follower of Jesus at age 17, I’ve read dozens and dozens of books about the Christian faith. I’ve learned just enough Greek and Hebrew to be dangerous, and I’ve listened to countless hours of podcasts focused on Jesus and the kingdom of God. No doubt I’ve learned some amazing lessons from the men and women whose words I’ve read or whose talks I’ve listened to over the years. But here’s the truth: some of the most enduring lessons I’ve learned have sprung from my experience teaching 5th and 6th graders about Jesus.\n\nMy job is to present the majesty of the gospel message to my audience of 10, 11, and 12-year-olds without compromising on truth, yet finding a way to talk about it in terms they can identify with. Perhaps the most impactful revelation the Lord has given me in the last five years arose from a lesson on the Sermon on the Mount. Only when I stopped long enough to teach this passage to 5th graders did I begin to understand what “poor in spirit” might actually mean in God’s economy.\n\nHave you ever seen a homeless person on the street with a message scrawled on a piece of cardboard? Sure, you have. It probably said something like, “Need food. Please help. God bless.” Sometimes a bit more detailed information is disclosed, but the ones you can typically read from the car as you roll by are the simple ones. Regardless of the content, these signs bear the same central message: HELP.\n\nWhat I’ve learned as an elementary school Bible teacher (in addition to finding out that kids have a lot more spiritual sensitivity and intelligence than I ever gave them credit for) is how simple God’s invitation to us really is. When Jesus says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs” (Matthew 5:3), He’s beckoning us to put down our ceaseless striving to be lord over our own lives. He’s pleading with us to stop wringing our hands over the notion that we can and should be masters of our own destinies. He’s freeing us from the lie that only the strong and self-sufficient will survive, even if they have to walk over the weak to get to where they want to go.\n\nThe heart of Jesus longs for us to develop a daily discipline of waiting for Him as we ask, HELP. That beautiful, powerful, four-letter word is all God needs to lead us the rest of the way home, to that sweet place where all God’s people will say in joyous unison, “Ours is the kingdom.”",

		"devo_summary": "By Guest Writer\n\nPeople from every nation will share in Jesus’s kingdom inheritance and mission.\n\nIf there’s one thing at which humanity excels, it’s drawing boundary lines. I remember playing a game with my friends, where we’d imagine traveling to a far-off country by spinning a globe and stopping it with a finger; wherever our finger landed would become our imaginary destination. However, the problem with that game was this: more than half of the time, we would hit a boundary line, because there are just so many in our world.\n\nOf course, we know that these boundaries are more than just ink on a page. Many wars were fought over these lines. Think of all the paperwork it takes to travel or trade across borders. They represent a deep division in history, culture, and identity.\n\nThe first Christians knew well the divisions caused by boundary lines. Even though their world was dominated by a pressing national identity, the unity that came from the Roman Empire was only as good as the military that maintained it. And yet, these early followers held to and were motivated by the vision of a people perfectly united, where people from every nation saw themselves as part of one family—citizens of one kingdom.\n\nAt the center of this vision is the reconciling work of Jesus the Christ. Jesus was the fulfillment of God’s agenda to mend the discord between the nations, as the apostle Paul writes, “[God] made known to us the mystery of his will… to bring everything together in Christ, both things in heaven and things on earth in him” (Ephesians 1:9–10). But how does Jesus bring the nations together when nothing else has? Scripture gives us two images by way of answer: the cross and the throne.\n\nIn Ephesians 2, Paul addresses divisions between the Jewish people and the Gentiles, an estrangement that had a long and sorrowful history. The apostle declares that Jesus had put their hostility to bed in His death on the cross when He brought both back into right relationship with God. By virtue of Christ’s death, these formerly warring factions were made “fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household” (Ephesians 2:19). In essence, Paul is saying, “On the cross, Jesus made you family! You share one blood now, and it’s Christ’s.”\n\nWe get another image in Revelation 5, this time of the throne room of God. Standing at the throne of creation is Jesus, the Lion and the Lamb. He is the true King of the world and all its nations, languages, ethnicities, and cultures. The attendants around the throne burst into song, singing, “You purchased people for God by your blood from every tribe and language and people and nation. You made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they will reign on the earth” (Revelation 5:9–10). The nations are brought together in God’s kingdom as they bend their knee, hand-in-hand, before the Lord of creation.\n\nWhat a compelling vision! The one who hung from the cross now sits on the throne, and in His kingdom all the nations of the earth are blessed. Lord, your kingdom come!",

		"devo_summary": "By Barnabas Piper\n\nHaving been inaugurated through Christ, God’s already-active kingdom will be fully established when Jesus returns.\n\nAs a teenager, I began to read the Bible consistently using a reading plan. Eventually, I made my way to the prophetic books, but I found them quite confusing. Here and there, I saw obvious prophecies of Jesus coming as the Messiah, but beyond that, I didn’t know how to read these books. It wasn’t until various faithful Bible teachers began to show me the layered complexity of Old Testament prophecies that I began to see their richness.\n\nToday’s reading from Isaiah 11 is such a passage, rich with imagery of the coming Messiah from the line of David. That much is fairly clear. But when it begins to speak of judgment, of equity for the poor and meek, of renewal and making peace, and of the nations seeking out this ruler, it seems clear something more is at hand than just the birth of Jesus. This is a promise of Jesus coming as man to save and coming back as King to purify and reign forever. God is telling us, through Isaiah, of His whole vision and plan to save sinners, judge evil, and establish the new heavens and the new earth.\n\nJesus echoed this prophetic depth throughout His ministry. In Luke 21, He spoke of wars and natural disasters as signs of coming judgment, and He was clear about His own return to fully establish His kingdom: “Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory” (Luke 21:27). But Jesus also told His listeners that their redemption was “near” and that “this generation will certainly not pass away until all things take place” (Mark 13:29–30).\n\nWe know Jesus has not returned yet. The generation to whom He was speaking passed away centuries ago. So, what did He mean? He was speaking of multiple spiritual realities at once. First, that of His kingdom being established and His followers representing Him in it. Second, that of His return to fully establish His kingdom for eternity. Third, that God’s timing is not like ours, so “near” must be understood according to God’s perfect plan. There is even more to it than this, but those three realities frame how we understand Jesus’s words.\n\nIn Romans 8, the apostle Paul helps us understand what this means for us. He says that “we also groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for adoption, the redemption of our bodies,” and “if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience” (Romans 8:23, 25). In 2 Timothy, Paul offers more encouragement on Christ’s return, saying, “For if we died with him, we will also live with him; if we endure, we will also reign with him” (2 Timothy 2:11–12).\n\nWe live between Jesus inaugurating His kingdom and finally establishing it in full. We live in the time of suffering, tragedy, and even persecution that Jesus told us about. But we do so with patience and hope because we are part of Christ’s kingdom that is spreading and being established. We are His kingdom representatives as we wait. We’re not merely biding our time. We live for Jesus, we look ahead eagerly to His return, and we must be patient in God’s timing.",

		"devo_summary": "By David Chaniott\n\nGod’s kingdom is characterized by service, humility, justice, righteousness, joy, and peace.\n\nThere is a saying attributed to Napoleon about Christ. He tried to compare Jesus to himself and other conquerors. “Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne and myself founded empires. But on what did we rest the creations of our genius? Upon sheer force. Jesus Christ alone founded His empire upon love; and at this hour millions of men will die for Him.” \n\nGod’s kingdom was not ushered onto the scene at the tip of a spear, not by Israel, or any nation’s power and might. There’s no conquering army marching under the flag of God’s jubilee. Instead, God alone shatters the yoke and staff of oppression (Isaiah 9:4). The Son of God shoulders the government of His glorious kingdom (v.6). The Spirit of the Lord is on His anointed one (Luke 4:18). \n\nIn Isaiah, the prophet describes how the people rejoice as if they were only dividing the spoils of war. It is like the triumph of a conquest, but instead, the trampling boots and bloodied garments of conquest are burned in the fire. This is all the celebration of a great victory, not against other people or other nations, but over violence and death itself. Peace, justice, prosperity, and righteousness follow in the wake of all conflict’s end.\n\nJesus’s kingdom is not a wave of military triumph; instead, His kingdom is the inauguration of peace. In the shadow of John the Baptist’s arrest, Matthew recalls these words from the prophet Isaiah: “The people who live in darkness have seen a great light, and for those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned” (Matthew 4:16).\n\nInstead of drums and heralds, Luke shows how Jesus’s ministry started as a quiet moment in His home synagogue (Luke 4:14). It is a mic-drop moment long before there were microphones. Jesus reads those words from Isaiah that promised His coming: “He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor” (Luke 4:18–19; Isaiah 61:1). And when He finished reading, Jesus just sat down.\n\nSoon, He began preaching, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near” (Matthew 4:17). And the one who could say of His Father, “He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted” (Isaiah 61:1) began to heal people. And from those quiet beginnings—first a few fishermen, and then large crowds from all across Palestine—the beginnings of those millions Napoleon spoke about, began to follow Jesus, the eternal King.\n\nThat is the kingdom we’re a part of now as believers. It is one ruled by Christ’s example of service, humility, and justice. Paul shows us how, in Christ’s kingdom, we live in freedom and because of that freedom, he urges us not to judge one another. In love and goodness, we walk with the Holy Spirit, as Christ brings us into His peace, joy, and righteousness.",

		"devo_title": "The Reign of the King",
		"devo_summary": "By Caleb Faires\n\nJesus demonstrated His authority as the true Son of God, who now rules at the right hand of the Father.\n\nI think a lot about the kingdoms of this earth. When the times get dicey, I have to make a conscious effort to not fixate on the latest headlines. Earthly rulers and magistrates busy themselves trying to establish their own dominion. In fact, we all tend to fixate on our own kingdoms, whether at home, at work, or in society. Perhaps that’s why the declaration of Christ in Matthew 28 comes as a shocking blow—welcome or unwelcome—to our petty worldliness: “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth” (Matthew 28:18).\n\nChrist’s authoritative claim is shocking for three reasons. First, He claims “all authority.” I think a lot of us would be more comfortable if He had just claimed some authority. That would allow us to stake out some space for ourselves. We might hold onto a few quiet minutes of self-indulgence each day, or an occasion to vent our complaints and frustrations. But Christ did not leave even the slightest room for our pride and ambition. As Abraham Kuyper, theologian and former prime minister of the Netherlands, once said, “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, ‘Mine!’”\n\nSecond, Jesus declares that He already has this authority. While the full establishment of His kingdom is still underway, He is clear that the authority and might, which we like to think still belong to us, “has been given” to Him already. We’re not waiting around for Him to take control—He already has it. His is the one true kingdom, and it is here to stay. The only question is whether we have eyes to see it, or if we will remain in foolish and fatal blindness to this truth.\n\nFinally, Jesus declares His authority “in heaven and on earth.” While He ministered in Galilee, Judea, and Samaria, He proclaimed a kingdom that was not of this earth. But that kingdom of heaven was not to remain relegated to some distant world. Indeed, Jesus taught His disciples to pray that the kingdom of heaven would take its place here too: “Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10). Jesus had no intentions of leaving the world the way it was when He entered it. He came to undo Adam’s curse, and to topple the rule of evil, “so that those of every people, nation, and language should serve him” (Daniel 7:14).\n\nAll this is true. Yet how often do we think of Christ’s kingdom? How often are we instead caught up in worry and fear, busyness and busy-bodying, about so many earthly dominions, while neglecting the greater kingdom? From the most powerful man to the lowliest servant, the same is true: If we are busy about our own kingdoms instead of His, we are squandering our time and energy. We are to be about His kingdom. So, as He taught us, we pray: “Thy kingdom come.” And Lord, may it come quickly.",

		"devo_summary": "By Andrew Stoddard\n\nGod’s kingdom came to reign on earth in a new, decisive way through Jesus.\n\nHave you ever wrestled with knowing or articulating your unique and specific purpose in this world? Some of us seem to struggle with “the what.” Some of us seem to struggle with “the why.” And others wrestle with “the how.” Regardless of the missing piece, it’s a common feeling. When we’re able to come up for air in the midst of the hustle and bustle of daily life, we all tend to wonder, from time to time, what we’re meant to do with what one American poet, Mary Oliver, called this “one, wild and precious life.”\n\nScripture gives us a lot of direction and guidance. God’s Spirit leads us in prayer and through promptings. But for many of us, the search for calling, mission, or purpose is an ongoing area of growth and refinement.\n\nThat’s why it’s comforting to know that Jesus was keenly and innately aware of His own purpose. It seems like He daily fixed His focus on the thing He knew He was meant to do. Even in His final days, under extreme emotional, relational, and physical duress, Jesus articulated clearly and confidently His mission. When asked by Pilate if He was “a king.” Jesus responded, “I was born for this, and I have come into the world for this: to testify to the truth” (John 18:37).\n\nGod, made flesh through the incarnation, declared it Himself: He was “born for this.” He was born to be the King who would testify to the truth and establish the kingdom of God in a robust manner here on earth.\n\nThe prophets foretold of this kingdom, and the people of God anticipated it with great hope. Yet, when it came in the flesh in this seemingly ordinary man, Jesus, they weren’t so sure. This kingdom did not look like what they expected. I think we still have trouble with that. The kingdom of God doesn’t always look like what we’re anticipating. N. T. Wright says it best: “Our whole culture is so fixated on dying and going to heaven, when the whole Scripture is about heaven coming down to earth.” Now, Wright is not denying the spiritual reality of the kingdom, or of heaven, but pointing out the ways in which our over-emphasis of the future and far away has eclipsed the present and personal.\n\nThe kingdom is here.\n\nThe kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of God, broke into our world in a massive, marked way through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. God’s kingdom came to reign on earth in a new, decisive way through Jesus. He knew that His mission—His purpose—was to live the life none of us could live, free from sin and shame, and to conquer death so that we could experience life in the coming kingdom both here and now, and on into eternity.\n\nOnce you opt into the kingdom life, once you lay everything down at the feet of Jesus and become a citizen of that kingdom, your meaning and hope is fully wrapped into the fate and trajectory of that kingdom. Daniel, long before the coming of Jesus, describes it as a “kingdom that will never be destroyed” (Daniel 2:44). Never has there been, and never will there be, another kingdom or rule like this. One that has begun here and now, and one that will endure forever.\n\nRecognize that your purpose, your calling, and your great work in this world is wrapped up in God’s kingdom, one that is already established. The King has marked the way. If you’ve come to put your life in the hands of Jesus, you were “born for this” kingdom work.",

		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nJesus came as the perfect, eternal King.\n\nC. S. Lewis called it “the scent of a flower we have not found, the echo of a tune we have not heard, news from a country we have never yet visited.” It’s that deep longing in us that tells us that this world as we experience it can’t be all there is. There must be something more. Something better. Something right. You feel it, don’t you?\n\nThis feeling is God-given and true. As we open this new reading plan exploring the wonder and nature of the kingdom of God, we begin with that longing—a longing for a perfect world, which could not exist without a perfect King.\n\nIn most every case in history, the pursuit of a better kingdom has involved finding and crowning a new and better leader. Sometimes this happens through a peaceful transition of power, other times it comes by way of a coup, but throughout the history of the world people have been restless to find a better world.\n\nHere’s how God’s kingdom is different. The goal is not to keep looking for kings who are better than the ones we have now—always searching, always coming up short. In God’s kingdom, the true and perfect King has existed since before the dawn of time. His eternal rule has never been in doubt, and neither have His qualifications. That’s what today’s passages walk through: the story of our Forever King.\n\nDuring the time of the Judges, when Israel had no official king, they fell into a cycle that inevitably ended in corruption and chaos. So, they asked God for someone to rule over them. God’s plan was to give them not just one king, but a kingly line that would live on forever. The Lord told King David that one would come from his line who would rule for all eternity as a perfect and just King.\n\nIsrael longed for this king. But the King God had in mind wasn’t going to be just another man. The King who was coming to them was going to be God too (Matthew 21:5). He would be the Savior born in Bethlehem to the wonder of the shepherds and the exaltation of the angelic host. The King the wise men sought so that they could worship at His feet, and the threat to Herod’s iron fist of control. He would be Isaiah’s Suffering Servant crucified for the iniquities of the people, atoning for their sins through His blood.\n\nEvery move Jesus made was to establish the kingdom over which He would reign forever. That’s what the longing in your heart and mine is pining for: an eternally secure and established kingdom, ruled by a perfect, eternal King. And that is what He is doing now. So, read on.\n\nIn the first part of this three-week study, we will look to Scripture to better understand Jesus, the King, and the nature of the kingdom of God. Then we’ll spend the remaining two weeks reading about life in the kingdom. Who are its citizens? What are its values, law, and purpose? What does it mean to enter into the kingdom of God while also anticipating it? How does King Jesus call us to live now, in light of who He is and all that is to come?",

		"devo_title": "Final Greetings",
		"devo_summary": "By Barnabas Piper\n\nThe final three verses of 2 Thessalonians are a beautiful benediction and blessing. Paul’s tone is warm and personal as he lifts the readers’ eyes to the peace of Christ. What is striking, though, is the seeming pivot from the previous verses in which Paul took a much more stern, fatherly tone and brought to bear his apostolic authority. To go from warnings and commands to peace and grace seems like whiplash at first glance.\n\nThat would be true if Paul were wishing his readers a peaceful sentiment or sending good vibes their way. He is not. He is offering them, as his final words, the power and means of living obediently to God and fulfilling the call of this letter. When he says, “May the Lord of peace himself give you peace always in every way” (2Thessalonians 3:16), he is not merely offering them his best wishes. The heart of what he is saying is this: Look to Jesus, live in Jesus, and Jesus will hold you close. It is a comprehensive statement, not a vague one. Look at the pieces.\n\n“May the Lord of peace Himself” does not refer to a sentiment or feeling or wish but the living Christ. “Give you peace” speaks to an action and a gift, a delivery of true peace from Jesus to believers. “Always and in every way” is the solution to every challenge and problem addressed throughout the letter; there is no part of life, no conflict, it does not cover.\n\nThis idea of “peace” is not distinct to this letter either. It is a recurring theme for Paul as he encourages and exhorts believers. In Philippians 4, he describes how “the peace of God, which surpasses understanding” will guard the hearts and minds of all believers who bring needs to God in prayer (Philippians 4:7). This peace is active and powerful in everything. It protects and transforms needy, fearful hearts.\n\nIn Colossians 3:15, Paul says believers should “let the peace of Christ… rule your hearts.” He expands on this, saying this means letting the “word of Christ dwell richly” among us in teaching and encouragement (v.16). Again, we see a peace that is powerful and tied directly to the words and will of Jesus Christ.\n\nPaul’s final words in this letter to the Thessalonians aren’t a pivot from the commands in prior verses, but rather the encouragement and reminder the readers needed in order to obey them. He is showing them that only in Christ and through Christ do they have hope and peace. Out of His abundant love, hope and peace are always available in every way—Jesus never runs out of them. Those who stay close to Him and abide with Him are able to live in this reality.",

		"devo_title": "A Call to Responsibility",
		"devo_summary": "By Chris Martin\n\nPerhaps the most difficult and important truth we must learn as Christians is that no work we do, no collection of good deeds or extraordinary acts of righteousness, can earn us entrance into God’s kingdom. Salvation is by grace alone (Ephesians 2:8–9). This truth is difficult, at least for those of us coming from a Western perspective, because we are so conditioned to believe in merit-based economies. What is more “American” than believing hard work leads to great reward? But the kingdom of God is radically different, and if we don’t buy into this truth, we may work so hard to earn our salvation that we miss out on the fact that it has already been earned for us!\n\nWhen we come to realize that our works don’t save us, we will find rest in the finished work of Christ (Hebrews 4:10). Still, we must not lose our fervor for the God of our salvation and the gospel. God Himself called work “good” in the garden (Genesis 1:31). And so, it is important for us to work diligently, too—in our vocations and callings, loving and serving others well, bearing God’s image to the world. It is a call and responsibility of Christian living to steward the gifts of God well.\n\nIn 2 Thessalonians 3:6–15, Paul is cautioning his readers against lazy living, while also reminding them of how he lived and served among them (vv.7–9). The point is clear: “If anyone isn’t willing to work, he should not eat,” he tells them (v.10). Paul has been made aware that some are relying on the generosity and work of others to sustain and provide for them, while their own hands remain idle. It’s not that they are unable to work. According to Paul, “They are not busy but busybodies,” to which he exhorts “such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and provide for themselves” (vv.11–12). But to the faithful who have remained productive and may be discouraged by the idleness of some in their community, Paul says, “As for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary in doing good” (v.13).\n\nDo not grow weary in doing good. What a deeply encouraging command from the apostle Paul. It can be easy to grow weary in this world. God knows this, and He equips us with everything good to do the work He’s called us to do (Hebrews 13:21). We do not work for our salvation, yet faithful work blooms out of a life that has been purchased by the finished work of Jesus, rooted in a deep love and affection for Him (Ephesians 3:16–19).\n\nWe must remember this: work accomplished for the kingdom does not happen apart from the King Himself (John 15:1–5). Plumbers fix pipes to the glory of God. Teachers grade papers to the glory of God. Fathers read bedtime stories to the glory of God. Husbands comfort their wives to the glory of God. The Christian life calls us to work with diligence, stewarding our relationships, gifts, and opportunities well. While work requires our best efforts, the burden is infinitely easier, lighter, when our gaze remains on our faithful God (Matthew 11:30). So do not grow weary, friends. Remember that God is with us.",

		"devo_summary": "By Jeremy Writebol\n\n“You will make it!” I said to my daughter with tears in my eyes as we descended the mountain after summiting its peak. The original euphoria we had of reaching the highest point on the range was quickly broken just five hundred feet from the top, when she slipped on a rock and severely twisted her ankle. With at least four more miles of hiking in front of us, and significant pain radiating through her leg, we both wondered if she could make it down the mountain. And yet, we knew we would. We had to. It was the only thing we could do.\n\nLiving in this world as followers of Jesus is difficult. Not only do we face the obstacles of our own sinfulness, but when you add to it the fragility of life and the temptations and trials of this world, you have to ask yourself if you are going to make it. I imagine that the Thessalonian church receiving this little letter from Paul would be asking the same thing, especially after being told of the coming judgment of God upon those who do not “accept the love of the truth [in order to] be saved” (2Thessalonians 2:10).\n\nThe Holy Spirit wants to give us assurance and confidence that, yes, we will make it. But it won’t be because we white-knuckled our way to our salvation. It won’t be because we were strong enough to get there on our own two feet. God Himself is the one who will bring everyone who trusts in Jesus home. Paul is confident-—even so much to thank God in that moment—that they will make it home. Why is that the case? Because of the loving, choosing, calling, sanctifying power of God “that [they] might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ” (2Thessalonians 2:14). They have trusted in the God of their salvation—therefore, they will make it.\n\nBrother, if that’s true, that you and I will make it to glory by the power of God, then what we are called to in this life is faithful perseverance. That’s precisely why we can “stand firm.” Paul doesn’t tell the Thessalonian believers to stand firm so that they make it to the end. He tells them that God will get them to the end, and because of this, they will be encouraged to keep going. “We have confidence in the Lord about you,” he assures them, “that you are doing and will continue to do what we command” (2Thessalonians 3:4).\n\nWe can stand against evil, stand against our sinful flesh, and we can be confident we will get home, not because we’re so unbelievably strong, but because “from the beginning God has chosen [us] for salvation” (2Thessalonians 2:13). So, keep going! Keep trusting and praying and working to see the Word of God spread rapidly. The Lord is faithful. You will make it, and He will do it.",

		"devo_summary": "By Matt Capps\n\nIf there is one thing that unsettles men, it is deception. If you have ever been lied to, deceived, or manipulated in any way, I imagine you have felt alarmed and shaken to your core. In a sense, this is justified; deception is born in the pits of hell.\n\nThe father of all lies is the defeated one, Satan. Jesus Himself makes it very clear that there is no truth in him (John 8:44). Moreover, one of the ways the evil one seeks to devour the faith and hope of the Church is by spreading deceptive doctrine (1Timothy 4:1). These things are important as we approach Paul’s second letter to the Thessalonians, when the church has been deceived to believe that the day of the Lord had already come.\n\nThe second coming of Christ is a foundational doctrine of the New Testament church. When speaking of Christ’s imminent return, Paul’s aim was to spur the church on through affliction and trials, toward the hope of Christ’s final vindication, where all things are made right.\n\nImagine if you are counted among the Thessalonian Christians, awaiting the return of Christ for final deliverance from life’s most difficult challenges. Now imagine that you have been deceived to believe that it has already occurred. You would probably ask questions like, Where is the final justice God promised? Where is the vindication of the righteous that Christ secured? Where is the fulfillment of God’s most comforting promises for the suffering believer?\n\nIf it were me, I would have been shaken, alarmed, even disheartened. For this reason, Paul urges the church to not “let anyone deceive you in any way” (2Thessalonians 2:3). This exhortation still holds true for us today. Satan has been a liar from the beginning. His aim has always been the same: to pull Christians away from their hope and joy in the promises of Christ. The deception of the church in Thessalonica was not so different from the other forms of deception used by Satan today.\n\nHave you ever been deceived enough to question if God really loves you? Have you ever been deceived enough to question whether or not God hears your prayers, or even cares? Have you ever been tempted to despair over your circumstances? In all of these cases, Satan’s aim is to steal your joy and diminish your hope.\n\nThe apostle Paul is clear: Let no one deceive you! Do not let the evil one rob you of your joy and hope in Christ. Deception is a spiritual war waged in the minds and hearts of men and women, fought by assaulting the lies of the enemy with the truth of God. Christian, take up your armor and fight for faith! We learned this from our Lord Jesus. Three times, the enemy tried to tempt Jesus, and three times, He rebuked the enemy with the truths found in Scripture (Matthew 4:1–11).\n\nDo not be deceived, but hold fast to the truth of the gospel. Cling to the truth of His Word.",

		"devo_summary": "By J.A. Medders\n\nHonor counts. When it comes to representing Christ, our actions aren’t irrelevant, but the good news is we aren’t left to navigate it all on our own. In today’s reading, the Thessalonian Christians are under severe persecution from the surrounding culture. The pressure to faithfully live as disciples of the crucified and risen God-Man are heating up around them. And yet, instead of retreating or dividing from one another, their love is increasing in all directions. Paul tells them, “We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, since your faith is flourishing and the love each one of you has for one another is increasing” (2Thessalonians 1:3).\n\nTheir devotion is so heart-warming that it even causes Paul to brag about them to other Christians. “Therefore, we ourselves boast about you among God’s churches—about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions that you are enduring” (v.4). When the apostle Paul is bragging on you, it’s got to be hard to stay humble—that is, unless you know, like Paul, where the strength to persevere originates.\n\nPaul doesn’t pray that the Thessalonians would muster their collective energies and elbow grease to be worthy disciples of Christ. Nor does he give them ten hot tips to be worthy of Christ’s call to discipleship, sanctification, and glorification. Rather, Paul guides the heart of the Thessalonians to where their focus—and ours—must reside.\n\nHe prays that God, not they themselves, will make them worthy of His calling. Paul remembers what we often forget: God will get us to the other side. God will strengthen us. God makes us fit for the call of discipleship. God gives us what we need to endure till the end. He is the fuel in our good works, the holy umph in our lives.\n\nWe can’t make ourselves worthy; the gospel is bad news for self-actualization. But the gospel is good news for sinners who realize they need a mighty Savior. Jesus alone makes us worthy. Paul wants the Thessalonian church to really take this in as they face persecution with hope. Their testimony of faithfulness brings glory to God, but even their faith is sourced from their faithful God.\n\n“In view of this,” Paul tells them, “we always pray for you that our God will make you worthy of his calling, and by his power fulfill your every desire to do good and your work produced by faith, so that the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ” (vv.11–12).\n\nWhatever challenges are ahead, they are not ahead of God or His work in making you fit for His calling. He is surely with you, just as He was with the Thessalonians.",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nWhen I gave my life to Jesus at age 17, I believed I could study my way into my new life. I thought if I read all the right books on the Christian faith, if I memorized enough Scripture, I could intellectualize my way into a perfect Christian existence. My brain would be the gateway to fully understanding the mind of God, and only then would my salvation be complete.\n\nWell, that didn’t pan out too well. It turns out that God’s free gift of salvation doesn’t need to be supplemented by mental gymnastics. The gospel doesn’t need to be improved upon, and sanctification is the work of the Spirit. I’ve found that relying so heavily on my own brain is a recipe for spiritual malaise and confusion; my quest for knowledge kept me from believing what the Bible says about those who follow Jesus Christ.\n\nNo amount of studying or contemplation could undo the lies so deeply embedded in my mind—the assertion that I was unworthy, tainted, unlovable, and hopeless. Sadly, I could not corroborate or reconcile the new peace and joy my heart had found in Jesus with the accusing voices in my head.\n\nYet, I persisted. Even into my early thirties, in the midst of my latest round of existential panic, I remember telling a pastor friend my plan: “I’m thinking if I read the Bible enough, I can brainwash myself into actually believing what it says about God and about me.” He calmly looked at me and solemnly said, “Bro, that sounds exhausting.”\n\nHe was right. Looking at Scripture as a tool to basically trick myself into being a more faithful Christian had wreaked havoc on my heart by way of my mind. What I wanted was God’s wisdom, but I had deluded myself into thinking that sharpening my own intellect would be tantamount to knowing the heart of God and walking faithfully with the Lord—in thought, word, and deed.\n\nNow, as I look upon the precipice of my forties, I like to think I’ve begun to reorient my thinking about the contrast between God’s wisdom and my intelligence. I’ll keep reading and studying God’s Word, but I see now that the only necessary ingredient for my salvation is Christ Himself. The only thing that can have a radical and meaningful impact on the way I live is the assurance of God’s commitment to us, those He has called His own.\n\nAbiding with Him, remaining in His presence, following His example, and resting in the continual work of the Holy Spirit—this is how Jesus makes us more like Him (John 15:4–5). And because He has called us, He will be faithful to sanctify us through His Spirit (1Thessalonians 5:24). Notice that verse doesn’t say, “As long as you get your act together and master your theology, you can do it.” Nope. It’s all about God’s faithfulness. It’s about His promise to follow through on what He started in our hearts when He invited us to come near and lay our burdens at His feet.",

		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nWhen I was in high school, I remember staying up until 3:00 am to finish reading the latest Christian fiction book about the rapture. Stories about the end times were a fascination to me, and they continue to be for many people to this day. Why? Because we’re all at least a little curious about how this is going to end, aren’t we?\n\nI am by no means an end-times theorist. I have two master’s degrees in theological studies and two decades of pastoral experience under my belt, and I am no more certain today about how the end times will unfold than I was back then. Maybe I’m even less sure now.\n\nBut here’s what I do know: Christ will return, and when He does, it will be a glorious occasion for all who believe in His name. Today’s passage makes that clear: “For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him” (1Thessalonians 5:9–10).\n\nIt can be so easy to reduce the Christian faith into little more than a moralistic way to behave, or a series of habits we form. We can forget that following Jesus is about the transforming relationship offered to us as disciples of Jesus Christ. As we follow Him, keeping in step with Him day by day, He makes us more and more like Him, reflecting His glory to the world through us. This is our call until the Day of the Lord, when He returns to rule and reign forever, establishing His kingdom here on earth as it is in heaven, and our place within it.\n\nLike a thief in the night Jesus will return, unexpected and unannounced. For those who believe, it will be like a great light coming on. And when it does, we will feel at home in that light because for all the darkness this world has, “we do not belong to the night” (v.5). The darkness now present in the world will give way to the light of Christ.\n\nI don’t know how much you think about end times stuff. Maybe not at all. Or maybe you have an entire bookshelf full of speculative fiction and eschatology. Either way, know this: We cannot know how or when Christ will return, but that isn’t really the good part anyway. The good part is the assurance that He will return, and that when He does, darkness will be overcome by the light of His power and glory forever. And this will be the reality we will know for all eternity.\n\nThat’s the good part.",

		"devo_summary": "By Collin Ross\n\nEarly in my ministry, I had the privilege of walking alongside a friend as they dealt with the passing of their mother. In the final moments of her life, as the whole family gathered around her bed, each of us experienced the sorrow of death and loss. And yet, improbably, as we shared prayers, memories, and the Lord’s Supper, the predominant emotion filling that cramped room was hope.\n\nThe deathbed has long been understood as a place where the veil between heaven and earth is incredibly thin. It’s where the hope that is ours through Christ’s resurrection moves from the theological to the personal. When the human heart truly receives the promises contained in the gospel, not even death can diminish that hope.\n\nThis is what Paul aims to communicate to the Christians in Thessalonica as they grieve the death of their friends. He is responding to a specific question that has arisen out of the Thessalonians’ grief: will those who have died miss out on the blessings of Christ’s return?\n\nAt the heart of this question is the thing that makes death unbearable. The primary pain of death is the separation it causes. One of the first places the grieving mind goes is to the future celebrations that our loved ones will miss. They won’t be there for the weddings, graduations, or birthdays. The single greatest celebration that the Thessalonians awaited was the day when Jesus would return to restore the fullness of God’s justice to the ends of the earth; but now, they wondered whether there’d be empty chairs at that party.\n\nSimply put, Paul’s answer is a resounding, “No!” Believers who have died will be raised to life in order that they, too, can participate with the living in the celebration of Christ’s return. Christians have an abiding hope even in the face of death, because the “Great Separator” has been defeated by the death and resurrection of Jesus!\n\nPaul paints an incredible picture of Christ’s return, drawn from prominent scenes in the Old Testament. Recalling the great descent of Yahweh to Mount Sinai to meet with Israel (Exodus 19:16–19) and the glorious ascent of Yahweh to Zion’s throne (Psalm 47:5), so too will Jesus come down to His people and take up the throne of creation. And greeting Christ at His arrival will be His people, the living and the resurrected, together once again. As Paul says, “Then we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord” (1Thessalonians 4:17).\n\nIt is right and appropriate to grieve the death of our loved ones. Jesus grieved, as did Paul. But in the midst of grief, we have an abiding hope. There is a great reunion on the horizon, and our joy will overflow as our separation from Christ and one another will be ended forever. Let us grieve, but let us also hope.",

I could hardly pass my high school physics class let alone explain how substantive scientific issues work. I have a hard time remembering what the formula for something as simple as momentum is. All I know is that if you push it and it rolls, inertia has been overcome. (Please email me if I’m wrong, physicists).\n\nEqually complex and difficult for me to explain is the concept of holiness. At times, I think I would do better explaining string theory. That’s how I feel when I hear people talk about holiness. It is an utterly essential component to the Christian faith, yet only the wisest, best minds seem to be capable of articulating what it is exactly. Often it comes with a Latin wrapper of language that muddles the concept for me even more.\n\nBut Paul makes holiness abundantly practical. In today’s passage he tells us that God’s will for our lives is that we are sanctified, which means “made holy.” He then unpacks what it means to “live in holiness,” explaining what it consists of in a practical way. It’s keeping away from sex outside the context of marriage, exercising self-control, loving your brother and sister in the Lord, minding your own business, working hard and well, and behaving as decent citizens in your communities (1Thessalonians 4:3–7).\n\nIn many ways the mystery of holiness is not all that mysterious. It’s readily practical and down to earth. Holiness isn’t something that is outside our grasp after all. God intends for us to be holy in our everyday lives—here and now. That is His will for us. That is what He has called us to (v.7).\n\nThe challenge Paul brings to the Thessalonians, and to us, is simply to keep pursuing this holiness. The practical outworkings of holiness are the simple things of everyday life. The question is, do we believe God’s Word for us more than we love our own way of living? Do we believe His way is better? Will we walk in the day-to-day holiness He has for us?\n\nUnlike string theory, holiness is not a complex, overwhelming mystery. It’s being faithful to your wife. Being vigilant against lust and sexual temptations. It’s keeping your word, loving your neighbor, and living an ordinary life that has been changed by God’s extraordinary grace. That’s the holiness we’re called to. We won’t be perfect. Thank God for His grace. But we are called to live in the holiness we’re given in Christ. And a big part of living in holiness is learning to walk in it.",

		"devo_summary": "By Chris Martin\n\nIn 2015, as my wife and I made our way home to Nashville from spending Thanksgiving with our families in Indiana, we hydroplaned on I-65. We hit a concrete barrier in the middle of the highway and flipped back into the southbound lanes of traffic, landing on the roof of our Toyota Camry. It was the most terrifying experience of both of our lives. We crawled out of the car with minor physical injuries but lasting emotional ones.\n\nThat horrifying event dramatically changed how I relate to my wife and how I love other people. You don’t walk away from a traumatic accident like that unchanged, even if physically unscathed.\n\nToward the end of his first letter to the Christians at Thessalonica, Paul encourages his readers by transcribing his prayer for them. In 1 Thessalonians 3:12, he prays, “May the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love for one another and for everyone, just as we do for you.”\n\nAs he says earlier in the chapter, Paul is anxious about the Christians at Thessalonica (vv.1–5). He fears that Satan has tempted these new believers to abandon the gospel because of the difficulty and persecution they’ve had to endure as a result of their faith in Jesus. But in today’s reading, as Paul finishes up his letter to his brothers and sisters in the faith, he feels the need to encourage them to continue to grow. If they are going to endure current hardships and afflictions, as well as troubles yet to come, they will need one another. They must learn to love each other in a way that cannot be quelled, no matter the circumstances they face. Their love must be strengthened in the face of persecution, not eroded by it.\n\nPaul’s prayer was for the Christians of Thessalonica to understand the depth of God’s love for them, trusting that from that understanding, their love for others would overflow. He also prayed that the Lord would “make [their] hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father” (1Thessalonians 3:13). Learning to love and live this way comes not from our own strength, but out of the abundant, overflowing love of the God who loved us first (John 4:19).\n\nThat terrible car crash drew my wife and I closer together, radically changing our relationship and how we love each other. It changed us. In the same way, we must learn to love one another in times of hardship with a love that is bolstered by difficulty, not defeated by it. And because of Jesus Christ, we can boast in our affliction, trusting that it will produce endurance, strengthen our faith, and grow our love for God and others (Romans 5:3–5). May the trials and difficulties we encounter serve to strengthen, not weaken, our love for His Church.",

		"devo_summary": "By David Chaniott\n\nThere is a modern religious parable about a man walking with God along a sandy beach. The shoreline serves as an allegory for the trials of the man’s life. At the end of the walk, the two of them turn back to look over his story. They see both their footprints in the sand, but only one set of footprints marks the times when his life was most afflicted. The man had felt abandoned in those troubles and had questioned God’s faithfulness. But the parable ends with God comforting the man, assuring him that he was not alone in those times because God had carried him through them.\n\nPaul’s version of that story might have gone a little differently. In Thessalonians, he uses heartfelt, personal words to support his friends and tell of his own troubles in reaching them. Twice, Paul tells them of how he longed to be with them, and when he could not, he sent Timothy, who was like a spiritual son to him, in his place. From Athens, he anxiously awaits for Timothy’s return and news of the church in Thessalonica. Deeply encouraged by their growth in Christian love and faith in the face of persecution, he writes to them, declaring, “Indeed you are our glory and joy!” (1Thessalonians 2:20).\n\nThe growing community of believers in Thessalonica were walking with each other in their trials, sharing in one another’s suffering and in one another’s comfort. That is how the Church works, both then and now. Paul says that the Father “comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction, through the comfort we ourselves receive from God” (2Corinthians 1:4). His Spirit is our greatest comfort because He shared in our affliction and understands our suffering, though He Himself never sinned (Hebrews 4:15).\n\nComfort does not always mean an end to suffering, but the Church can be a relief in the midst of suffering. Look at grief as an example; the loss of a brother or sister in Christ is not undone by comfort. But when a church community comes together to grieve, the burden of suffering and the relief of joy are shared. The weight of individual suffering becomes lighter when shared in community, when sorrow turns to hope (Lamentations 3:19, 21–22). The hope of all is the hope of one.\n\nThe Church offers that support, from the saints in Paul’s day to the congregations we are a part of now, both locally and globally. Above all, we have with us the love and mercy and comfort of the Father, the suffering Christ, and the Holy Spirit, who guides and kindles the Body of Christ.\n\nSo, if Paul were telling that story about footprints in the sand, yes, the man would certainly see the footprints of the Father and His Son. But he’d see Paul’s, too. And Timothy’s. Yours and mine. That whole beach would just be filled with the footprints of fellow believers.",

		"devo_summary": "By Caleb Faires\n\nSometimes I sketch and illustrate as I listen to podcasts. I like to hear folks explain how they built their business, artists discussing their craft, and one earnest naturalist navigating walks in the English countryside. It’s interesting and diverting, but the essential thing I need every day is Scripture. My heart is not truly satisfied with anything else. There is good news: we are not supposed to be satisfied with the changeable voices of other human beings. Even better than this, we are not left blind in this foolish world, but have been given the clear and unchanging word of God.\n\nPaul’s commendation of the Thessalonians is both instructive and encouraging. He commends them, first, for receiving and welcoming the preached word. This was the word that God had appointed Paul and the apostles to preach, that those who hear might believe, call on the name of the Lord, and be saved (Romans 10:8–17). Like the good soil in the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:1–9), the Thessalonians had warmly received the word (1Thessalonians 2:13).\n\nNot only this, but they received it for what it was: the very word of God. The word of men perishes and is often false. But the word of God gives no cause for doubt. It is a living and active word, discerning all things (Hebrews 4:12). It is unchanging and effective, an almighty word that does not return void (Isaiah 40:8, 55:11), bearing fruit in all who receive it.\n\nIndeed, Paul notes how the received word has transformed the Thessalonians into imitators of God. Having welcomed the word, they became courageous even in the face of persecution, holding fast to the truth. Consider what a contrast is found in their persecutors; having rejected the word, they have become displeasing to God, hostile to everyone, and fill up their sins to the limit until wrath overtakes them.\n\nThere is no middle ground; we are either hot or cold. There comes a time when we all must either receive the word of God, or reject it. For some, as for the church in Judea and for the Thessalonians, this time of decision was marked by overt persecution. From Adam in the garden, to Abraham at Ur, to you and me living with our modern amenities—we will all either receive or reject the word. At all times, this is the crux of every issue.\n\nIf you find yourself dissatisfied with the voices of this world, good. We have been made for something far more enduring, far richer, far truer. If you are hungry for unchanging truth, for life-giving and heartening transformation, for light that pierces the darkness, for life that shatters the grave, good. Welcome the word of God, which works effectively and bears fruit in all who believe.\n\nThe word of God doesn’t just help us deal with a fickle and fallen world. It didn’t just help the Thessalonians endure persecution. It answers the world’s rumbling folly with the resounding fruit of courage, joy, and thanksgiving. It produces a harvest thirty, sixty, and even a hundred-fold. And this is why, like Paul, we give thanks to God wherever we see the word bearing its good fruit.",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nI tend to receive encouragement through the thick lens of cynicism. If someone is trying to nudge me along with a “You can do it!” speech, I must confess that I (metaphorically) roll my eyes a full 360 degrees in their sockets. Or, if someone tries to comfort me in the midst of hard times, there’s a voice in my head that says, “They don’t get it! How can they tell me everything will be alright when they have no clue?” When someone begs or implores me to do something—forget it! Surely, they have some unspoken, selfish motives, or worse: they’re trying to control me. As someone who has made an idol in my heart of being the master of my own devices, I don’t take kindly to being manipulated.\n\nI’m not proud of my natural cynicism, my skepticism of people, or my impulse to be in control—though I have encountered my share of ostensibly trustworthy people, who have turned out to be not so safe in the end: people who have spoken in error and were just wrong or mistaken; people who have tried flattery as a means to get something out of me; and people whose motives were eventually revealed to be pretty greedy. I’m sad to say these experiences have hardened my heart, even toward people who have earnestly sought to support, assuage, and motivate me.\n\nThese are precisely the terms Paul uses to reassure his friends in Thessalonica about his own agenda for sharing the gospel. He asks his brothers and sisters in the faith to consider the facts of his ministry and service, his time spent with them in person, when each of them was “encouraged, comforted, and implored… to walk worthy of God, who calls [us] into his own kingdom and glory” (1Thessalonians 2:12).\n\nAs followers of Jesus whose hearts are trained on the goal of walking with the King, we need people around us to encourage, comfort, and implore us toward that end. And, with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us, we can discern the hearts of those who come alongside us. “For each tree is known by its own fruit” (Luke 6:44), which means we will know who our genuine friends are by simply paying attention. We can put our cynicism aside and let God be in control over our lives and our hearts. Our true companions in the effort to grow closer to Jesus will reveal themselves soon enough.\n\nWhen we trust God and allow people to speak into our lives from a place of earnest gentleness and care, we find ourselves in a much stronger position to actually walk with the Lord. And we discover that we don’t have to do it alone.",

		"devo_summary": "By Andrew Stoddard\n\nWhen I read Paul’s warm greeting to the church at Thessalonica, I’m reminded of a poignant quote from Catholic thinker Henri Nouwen: “When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand.”\n\nSimply put, real friends are the ones who stick with you through the tough stuff. Instead of pontificating about the philosophical realities you’re facing, they’re the ones who enter the mess with you. They walk with you through the challenges and the painful moments, regardless of whether or not you’ve reached resolution, healing, or victory.\n\nThe apostle Peter tells us we should not be surprised when affliction comes our way. “Instead,” we ought to “rejoice as [we] share in the sufferings of Christ, so that [we] may also rejoice with great joy when his glory is revealed” (1Peter 4:13). Peter is primarily talking about our individual sharing of Christ’s sufferings with Him. However, there is another layer here; we are to rejoice in sharing Christ’s sufferings with one another. For Peter knew that shared suffering and perseverance would build not only a deeper connection with Christ, but also a more tightly knit community within the body of Christ.\n\nPerhaps part of Paul’s profound appreciation for the church at Thessalonica stemmed from the fact that they had stuck with him and supported him through thick and thin, “in spite of severe persecution” (1Thessalonians 1:6). Yet they had not grown weary in doing good, caring for those in need, or preaching  “the word of the Lord,” which “rang out from [them]” through faith (v.8).\n\nWhile Paul initially wrote this passage as a blessing and commendation, there is an implicit call for all of us in this prayer of blessing. As members of the Body of Christ, we are meant to share in Christ’s suffering. This often means that we will endure hardship and resistance for the sake of His name and His gospel. This also means we are called to lend a “warm and tender hand” to our friends and other members of the Body.\n\nFriends, this is where the rubber meets the proverbial road. When we lend our time, our treasures, and our talents to those in need—perhaps at the expense of our own comfort and security—we glorify God and participate in His kingdom work. Instead of fearing the fiery trials, we should aspire to be the kind of local church Paul would thank God for in this present age: empowered by the Holy Spirit to faithfully endure with one another and persevere against that which opposes God’s kingdom.\n\nThat’s how we become a cause for thanks in tumultuous and painful times.",

		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nToday’s Reading: You’ll notice the Scripture reading for today is longer than the others. These chapters from the book of Acts provide context for our study of 1 & 2 Thessalonians.\n\nHave you ever been through a tough season, one where you wondered how much more you could bear? Have you ever felt alone in your calling? Have you ever worked at something you believed you were supposed to do, but were met with more opposition than welcome? Have you ever gotten so tired you wondered if you could press on? I have.\n\nWhen the apostle Paul wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians, I have to believe he knew that feeling. He had given his recent years to proclaiming a simple, but polarizing, message: “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah” (Acts 17:3). The Holy Spirit was working through Paul, but the road to spreading the gospel was tough.\n\nWhen Paul arrived in Corinth during his second missionary journey, he was beat up, weary, and ready for some encouraging news. Up to that point, he had been driven out of nearly every town he’d visited. It is a miracle of the Holy Spirit that the opposition he faced had not worn him down to nothing.\n\nBut it wasn’t all opposition. He had seen a few churches take hold along the way. One of those churches was in the port city of Thessalonica, the capital of the Roman province of Macedonia. Today’s reading from the book of Acts gives us the narrative of Paul’s relationship with the Thessalonians—how he planted that church, how the new believers there took his message about the Messiah to heart, and how they stayed hungry for the gospel, learning from Timothy in Paul’s absence.\n\nPaul’s letters to the Thessalonians are like so many of his other letters: filled with theological clarification and instruction for how to live the Christian life. But it doesn’t take long to see that these letters are also a little different from the others, filled with words of affection for these believers who have been a tremendous encouragement to Paul.\n\nThe legacy of Paul’s letters to the Thessalonians is evidence of the Spirit’s work in the world. Were it not for missions like the one that took Paul to Thessalonica, we would not have the gospel today. And were it not for the Holy Spirit’s work, those missions would have failed to build anything lasting.\n\nSo, when you’re struggling, wondering if you can go on, remember this: the Holy Spirit is at work in the world still. How can we know this? Because Jesus promised He would send the Spirit as our helper in this life (John 14:15–31). When your faith is in Jesus, the Messiah, you are never alone.\n\nIn the face of impossible odds and unbearable weariness, God is at work. May the Lord encourage your heart as you read these letters and the story surrounding them.",

		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nEarly on the first Easter morning, some of Jesus’s friends went to His grave to anoint the body of their friend and teacher. But when they arrived, they were greeted by a man dressed in white, or what another one of the Gospel writers described as “dressed in clothes that gleamed like lightning” (Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4), who told them Jesus was not there, as He’d told them. He had risen (Mark 16:6–7).\n\nEvery time an angel appears to people in Scripture, the human response is fear. This encounter was certainly no different. The encounter mirrors when the angel appeared to the shepherds outside Bethlehem to tell them that a Savior had been born unto them. To the shepherds, the angel came to announce that Jesus had come to them. To the women at the tomb, the angel came to tell them He had gone—but that He would appear again to them soon.\n\nThe resurrection of Jesus opened a door between the fallen, groaning world into which He was born and the renewal of all things (Ephesians 1:18–23). When Jesus Christ came in the flesh to be the mediator between God and man (Hebrews 2:5–9), five crucial things happened, and they carry on even still.\n\nFirst, He lived the life of perfect righteousness we’ve all failed to live. He also died as a lamb led to the slaughter, Isaiah says, offering Himself as the perfect sacrifice to atone for the sins of the world, once and for all (Isaiah 53:7). Even this did not defeat Him; instead, He rose from the grave defeating death itself (Mark 16). Jesus Christ now lives as the appointed heir of all things, bearing all authority in heaven and on earth (Matthew 28:18; Hebrews 1:2–3). He now rules over every corner of creation, putting every enemy under His feet, while making alive by His grace through faith those who were dead in their sins (1Corinthians 15:20–26; Ephesians 2:5).\n\nHe meant to do all of this.\n\nIf Jesus has not risen, those who trust in Him are to be pitied because their hope extends no further than their wishful thinking. Their faith is futile, and they remain in their sins (1Corinthians 15:17–19). But if Jesus has risen, then His disciples are born into a new hope, because just as death entered the world through one man, Adam, now resurrection has done the same through the incarnate Son of God, who has prevailed over the power of the curse. The last enemy, death itself, has been destroyed (vv.21–26).\n\nJesus meant to lay down His life for you. And as sure as He has taken it up again, He knows you.\n\nHappy Easter.",

		"devo_summary": "By Barnabas Piper\n\nI have stood by more than a few gravesides after a casket was lowered into the ground. I have visited the graves of long-dead relatives and longer-dead historic figures. There is an empty finality to a graveside, a realization of termination. The dates on the headstone are the bookends of a lifespan.\n\nThe grave of Jesus had the same feel. It was just as lifeless, in the truest sense of the word, and cold. The void felt by His loved ones would have been just as pronounced, if not more so. After all, they had thought He was the Messiah, the promised one who would set God’s people free. But then He was crucified and died. In an act of courage and kindness, Joseph of Arimathea sought permission to bury Jesus before the Sabbath—even more courageous because he was part of the very ruling body that just condemned Jesus to death. Mark 15:46 says, “Joseph took him down and wrapped him in the linen. Then he laid him in a tomb cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.”\n\nSo, it was over. The Son of God was laid to rest, a gentle act after a brutal death. It echoes of Lamentations 3:1–9, where the prophet writes of being encircled in bitterness, wasting away, walking in darkness, walled in by God. For it was God who brought this about.\n\nThankfully, Lamentations 3 does not end there. In verses 22–23, we read, “Because of the LORD’s faithful love we do not perish, for his mercies never end. They are new every morning.” God brought about the death of Christ to make this true. We are able to truly say “we do not perish” because Jesus perished in our place. We are able to look to new mercies because He took on judgment and pain reserved for us.\n\nWhen we think of “new mercies,” we must not only think of the small pleasantness each day brings but also the redefining reality Colossians 1 tells us of. It describes Jesus as “the firstborn over all creation” (v.15). When we read this in the context of Jesus’s death and burial, it points to the promise of resurrection; He is the first of the resurrected into glory. A few verses later, Paul explains further, saying, “But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death, to present you holy, faultless, and blameless before him” (v.22).\n\nThe death and burial of Jesus were essential to reconcile us to God. They were the only way. They gave every appearance of defeat, of loss. But this loss was the sacrifice that made way for the greatest victory.",

		"devo_summary": "By Collin Ross\n\nFor many inside the Church, these words have become too familiar. Many Bible readers come to the story of Christ’s crucifixion with later New Testament ideas in their mind that color the account in the language of justification and salvation. These themes, while certainly aspects of what happened at Golgotha, are not Mark’s primary message. It’s important that we listen to his words anew, and strive to hear what he wants to say.\n\nLike a stone skipping across a river, Mark tells his story in a series of short, staccato scenes. Soldiers brutally mock Jesus, their biting tone escalating into a hail of blows. A bystander is forced to carry the wooden beam of the cross in lieu of the weakened Christ. Refusing the numbing wine, Jesus is stripped naked and nailed to the cross. The soldiers, the crowd, and even the condemned all hurl insults as His life wanes. Mark doesn’t linger on any of these scenes, but in his telling, there is a theme repeated again and again: Jesus is crucified because He is the King of Israel.\n\nThis is what the chief priests couldn’t understand. They called out to the dying Jesus, “Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe” (Mark 15:32). They couldn’t understand that it is because He is the King that He must remain on the cross. This is exactly what the King had come to do. This was His royal vocation. This is how the kingdom was to come.\n\nThrough the darkness of Christ’s pain, humiliation, and abandonment a new world was born. The curtain of the temple was torn in two, signaling that God’s presence was now open to all through the death of His Son. The temple’s purpose had been fulfilled once and for all by the Lamb of God upon the cross. The King’s task was now complete.\n\nAll of this is strange, wonderful, and entirely unexpected; but Mark isn’t finished. In the final scene we hear a familiar refrain. We heard it first in the opening of Mark’s Gospel, as Jesus is described as the Messiah, the Son of God. We heard it again at Christ’s baptism and transfiguration: Jesus is God’s beloved Son. Now for the first time, a human being calls Jesus the Son of God, and it’s not a priest, a disciple, or even a Jew.  “When the centurion, who was standing opposite him, saw the way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” (Mark 15:39).\n\nMaking this declaration of belief is a violent man in a Roman uniform—a symbol to the Jewish people of everything that was wrong with the world. Mark’s message is clear: the kingdom has come, and a new age has begun. God has done something so wonderful that the most hardened of hearts will soften before the shadow of the cross. Out of the horror of His death, the King had ushered in new life.",

		"devo_title": "Jesus Prays in the Garden",
		"devo_summary": "By Nick Batzig\n\nNo one has ever come close to modeling what a prayer life ought to look like so much as our Lord Jesus Christ. He was constantly pulling away from the crowds and from His disciples to have His soul strengthened in communion with His Father. He is the eternal Son, equal with the Father in divine power and glory, yet He is fully man and subject to all the needs of a human soul. Jesus needed to pray throughout His earthly ministry. And, while His example allows us to learn many things about our own need to commit to a life of prayer, there was something distinct about Jesus’s prayers. This is observed in the Garden of Gethsemane where He began His sufferings for our redemption.\n\nWhen Jesus and His disciples entered this place of solitude, “he told [them], ‘Sit here while I pray’” (Mark 12:34). There is a process to how Jesus pulls Himself away from the disciples in the garden. He separates from them, returns to them, and then goes back to pray further away from them. Though He expressed His need for their prayers, He was left to pray alone as they slept. This was a physical parable of sorts.\n\nScottish minister Eric Alexander explained that as Jesus pulled away from the disciples to pray, “He moved out into the no-man’s land of human sin and shame, and the agony of bearing the burden of it, the spiritual distance was infinite.” Jesus alone could accomplish redemption for us. He alone would drink the cup of God’s wrath in our place. The loneliness of Jesus there in the garden, praying, symbolized the singular task He had come into the world to accomplish.\n\nThe Savior did not shrink back from the eternal plan of redemption, though He was “deeply grieved to the point of death” (Mark 14:34). Instead, He brought Himself entirely before the Father, falling face-down in prayer, acknowledging the enormity of the coming hours, asking if the cup might pass from Him, and yet, ultimately, submitting to the will of the Father (vv.35–36).\n\nSoon, He would be separated from the Father for the first and only time, taking on the wrath of God, and giving His life up as a ransom for many (Mark 10:34–35). For you and for me and for all of humanity. Through His prayer in that garden, Jesus gained the strength He sought to go forward with the work the Father had given Him to do. The writer of Hebrews tells us that He was heard for His godly fear when He prayed with tears to the only one who was able to save Him from death (Hebrews 5:7). And His prayer was answered through His own death and resurrection.\n\nWhen we realize all that Jesus endured for us, how can we not thank Him for what He accomplished? His resolve to press through the agony and loss of fellowship with the Father paid for our redemption. In turn, how can we not seek to grow in communion with Him? The example of Jesus’s prayer in the garden is the most heart-stirring motivation for our own life of prayer.",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nJust the other day, waiting at a stop light, I came across a homeless man with a sign asking for money. I knew I had some cash stuffed in my wallet, so I flagged down the man. We exchanged pleasantries, and I offered a perfunctory “God bless you, brother,” as I rolled up the window. There. That’s the good part.\n\nBut what I left out of the story was the posture of my heart in the transaction. I knew I had an assortment of ones and twenties; there may have even been a couple of Lincolns in the mix. When I reached for the cash, I stole a glance out of the corner of my eye to make sure I only grabbed a single. I repeat: I made sure I only grabbed a single. While I was determined to share something with the man, I was only willing to give up the least of what I had to offer. I can’t explain the details of my calculus in that moment, but I know for sure that I was unwilling to part with one of my precious twenty-dollar bills. Even a 5-spot felt like too much to surrender to this hapless stranger.\n\nWhat is there in my heart that made me think this guy just wasn’t worth more than a single dollar? Certainly, I wouldn’t miss a buck, but five? Twenty? Sorry, buddy. I’m saving the good stuff for something or someone more important (me).\n\nI think the reason Jesus made such a big deal of defending the woman in Mark 14 was to make sure we got the message: hoarding our treasure for some vague, future occasion is contrary to God’s heart for giving, and it sullies the value of the treasure itself. “Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her” (Mark 14:9). The memory He wants us to hang on to is her impulse to spare no expense on Jesus.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that the man I encountered was actually the Word made flesh, Jesus of Nazareth Himself. Nor am I saying that God is watching, clipboard in hand, taking notes on how much money I give away in order to measure my worthiness. What I mean to say is that opportunities to give allow us to participate in the love of Jesus—not to earn it, but to share in it.\n\nThere is much to be said for tendering our very best to those whom God puts in our path. There are eternal implications for the heart that gives out of the abundance which it has freely received. In those rare moments when we muster the courage to give with reckless abandon—when we trust Jesus enough to supply us with what we need, so we can be generous ministers of our inheritance—we have the privilege of participating in God’s boundless love.",

		"devo_summary": "By Cameron Thomas\n\nHow do we prepare for a transition? We know how the saying goes: “All good things must come to an end.” The Gospel of Mark continues to point us to the picture of Christ as a suffering servant, whose message has pierced hearts, but what now? Where will He go from here with His message?\n\nThe way of life for many of Jesus’s followers is beginning to change. They have been eyewitnesses with a front-row view as Christ has inaugurated the forthcoming kingdom of God. This message serves as an equalizer for rich and poor, those of social status and even the outcast. The gospel message serves to turn the world upside down. Future endeavors and goals will be brought about with social and political upheaval and unrest. Jesus uses a familiar metaphor of the fig tree to build up the anticipation of the Messiah’s reign. Jesus tells them, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away” (Mark 13:31). In other words, they are to remember that God’s faithful Word can be trusted.\n\nApproaching this timeframe will come at a cost to many. Those willing to listen and hear Him were blessed to witness His ministry and its impact, hopefully turning their hearts and lives over to Him. But now, they must turn their sight toward envisioning a life without Jesus. Suffering and isolation is on the horizon for all who follow Him.\n\nBelievers are reminded that the true prize is not an established kingdom here on earth but the timeless truth of God’s Word. People change and ideas evolve over time, but God’s Word is timeless and trustworthy. The solid foundation of God’s Word calms our deepest fears and dries weeping eyes.\n\nThe disciples have witnessed the ministry of Jesus but must now prepare for His departure, one that will leave them seemingly destitute. Their comfort for the future is our comfort at present and beyond: God’s Word will stand. Christ invites His followers to be watchful and to not waver. The swift transitions of life present a diversity of scenarios that will seem insurmountable aside from God’s help. Believers turn not to the systems of the world but are comforted by the unfailing Word of God. The faithful look to Him and His promises during perilous times to anchor their hope in a future yet to behold.\n\nWhat transitions are about to take place in your own life? Do you feel prepared for what is about to transpire? Systems fail and promises wax cold. The incarnate one affirms that the cosmos is no limitation to the Son of God—He has beginning and no end. Humans and their earthly ways are like grass; they will wither, but the Word of God will stand forever (Isaiah 40:7). Christ affirms that tribulations will be triumphed to reveal a glorious coronation. Trials will be triumphed over, and believers will forever be in the presence of the Almighty. Our hearts should be comforted as He is “making everything new… these words are faithful and true” (Revelation 21:5). We are in the midst of an unstable and expiring world, but the promises of God have no expiration and shall endure eternally.",

		"devo_summary": "By David Chaniott\n\nIn high-school, my friend, Bill, was outraged after a history class. The teacher got something wrong, and Bill raised his hand to say, “Uh, Harry Truman wasn’t the president at the beginning of the Second World War.” His teacher did not accept the correction gracefully and scolded Bill for speaking up. When class was over, he motioned Bill over to talk alone, saying, “Listen, Bill. We both know you’re a lot smarter than me, but please just don’t embarrass me like that in front of the other kids.”\n\nAs a teenager, he felt slighted by his teacher’s words, but today, now a professor himself, Bill has found an enormous amount of delight when his students surpass him in knowledge, skill, and understanding.\n\nThat history teacher reminds me a bit of the Pharisees and Sadducees. Insecure in the presence of Jesus, they wanted Him to fail and tried to catch Him in a mistake. The scribe, on the other hand, asked a softball question: “WhIch command is the most important of all?” (Mark 12:28). Jesus’s response did not unmask some ancient mystery; everyone present would have likely known the answer. Moses and Joshua preached it and countless priests after them: “Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength” (Mark 12:28,30; Deuteronomy 6:5).\n\nThe teachers knew the commandment, and thousands of years later, we, too, know we are supposed to love God and our neighbor. So, if we all understand this command, why, as Peter puts it, do we “disobey the word”? (1Peter 2:8). Because in our sin, we believe the lie that Jesus is not enough, that He is capable of making mistakes. Maybe we aren’t all that eager to learn from Him. When things don’t go as we’d planned, our instinct is not to follow the way of Jesus. Like the Pharisees and Sadducees, we would rather try to teach Him. We do not love His ways. But rejecting God’s command is rejecting Jesus—and rejecting Jesus is rejecting God’s love altogether.\n\nThere is a double meaning in Jesus’s response to the scribe: “You are not far from the kingdom of God” (Mark 12:34) because Christ was standing right next to Him. That scribe was beginning to understand; his eyes were opening to how obedience of the heart is more important than all the empty burnt offerings and sacrifices. And as we come to understand how God’s love is at the heart of obedience, we understand more of how His kingdom works.",

		"devo_summary": "By Nick Batzig\n\nA friend of mine was in Ireland during the World Cup in 2002. As she listened to the crowds cheering in the town where she was staying, she said, “I sometimes wonder what it would sound like if Christians praised Jesus for His redeeming glory like that.” That statement has stuck with me over the years for the simple reason that in Scripture, we are given an example of how believers ought to praise Jesus—namely, in the record of His triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Zechariah had prophesied of the promised Redeemer, when he said:\n\n“Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!\n\nShout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!\n\nLook, your King is coming to you;\n\nhe is righteous and victorious,\n\nhumble and riding on a donkey,\n\non a colt, the foal of a donkey” (Zechariah 9:9).\n\nWhen this prophecy was ultimately fulfilled in Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem, He was surrounded with shouts of praise and rejoicing. The people who went before Him and those who followed recognized that He was the long-awaited Son of David. And so, they cried out accordingly,\n\n“Hosanna!\n\nBlessed is he who comes\n\nin the name of the Lord!\n\nBlessed is the coming kingdom\n\nof our father David!\n\nHosanna in the highest heaven!” (Mark 11:9–10).\n\nThe contrast between the visible circumstances and the shouts of praise are striking. There was no outward pomp to encourage such a joyful reception. As Zechariah had foretold, Jesus was “humble and riding on a donkey.” The throngs crowding around Him were fisherman and tradespeople. Yet, they saw something that their religious leaders could not see. They saw the incarnate Son of God coming “righteous and victorious,” and they praised God for sending the long-expected Messiah.\n\nThough I grew up in churches that faithfully preached God’s Word, I only remember one sermon preached when I was a very young boy. A minister in a Presbyterian church was preaching on the triumphal entry, and he said emphatically, “This is God sitting on the donkey!” The people singing out, “Hosanna!” recognized something in the One who sat on the donkey.\n\nSadly, in a matter of days, the shouts of praise would be drowned out by cries for the blood of the Son of God. Instead of “Hosanna in the highest heaven!” (Mark 11:10), the crowds would cry, ‘Crucify him!” (Mark 15:13). Instead of “Blessed is the coming kingdom,” the people would cry, “We have no king but Caesar” (John 19:15). But in the rejection of this King, God worked to forever fill the hearts of His people with joy. He rode into Jerusalem in order to hang on the cross for our sins. There is nothing that ought to stir our hearts more than to know that the King who rode into Jerusalem on a donkey, shed His blood for our eternal redemption and reconciliation to God. This means we have every reason to constantly shout, “Hosanna in the highest heaven!”",

		"devo_summary": "By Alex Florez\n\nI have tried on many occasions to push a camel through the eye of a needle, and it never works. I want to inherit eternal life, but I also want to keep my earth-bound resources intact. Frankly, the very thought of parting ways with the things I possess chafes at my sense of personal value. It is through the lens of my material wealth, after all, that I understand my worth. I’m tempted to believe that how much I own determines my present status, while how much I have to spend helps me forecast all that I will be entitled to later.\n\nBut the tension between my desire to abide in Jesus and my preference to be lord of my own resources is due to a basic misunderstanding of wealth: not only where it comes from, but also what I’m expected to do with it once I begin to follow Jesus. All too often, I have approached His throne as if His offer of eternal life depends on whether or not I bring anything of value to the table. This premise is false, and therefore, I would do well to take a lesson from the story of the rich young ruler.\n\nThis ambitious yet misguided character in Mark 10 decides that Jesus has asked him to do something impossible (vv.21–22). And you know what? I think he’s right. You cannot truly give away what was never yours to begin with. Ironically, the use of the word “inherit” is a clue to our actual status in God’s family. It is the goodness and mercy of our heavenly Father that secures eternal life for those who follow Him. In other words, we do not “get” eternal life by following Jesus and performing a series of required actions. Rather, we follow Jesus in response to the reality that He has already bequeathed eternal life to us. We become free to share what we have freely received.\n\n“With man it is impossible, but not with God, because all things are possible with God” (Mark 10:27). He can do what I could not bring myself to do in my own strength. If we believe our money and assets derive primarily from our own ingenuity and hard work, then we will find it excruciating, if not impossible, to give them up, even if Jesus directly commands us to do so. Instead, we must recognize that everything we possess is a gift from God—every penny and every square inch of property we own. Suddenly, we find ourselves clinging less to our material wealth and more to the hands from which these temporal blessings originate.\n\nEven then, Jesus may not require that I sell everything and give all of it to the poor, but if He does, I believe it will not be impossible, as it is when I try doing it on my own recognizance. In fact, I may finally bear witness as Jesus performs a miracle before my very eyes. I may get to see Him effortlessly push that camel through the eye of a needle.",

		"devo_summary": "By Collin Ross\n\nWhen wishful thinking becomes authentic reality, everything changes. Several years ago, as my wife and I were nearing graduation from seminary, we found ourselves daydreaming about traveling somewhere exotic to celebrate such a special milestone. However, we knew that given our situation, a trip like that was pure fantasy.\n\nIndeed, graduation came and went. We moved three times, found jobs, got a dog, started a family, and still the daydream lingered—that alternate reality where we’d lounge on the shore of an island paradise. And then, everything changed. A generous gift. A window of time. In a flurry of unexpected events, all the dominoes fell into place, and we were booked for a Hawaiian getaway. Almost overnight, wishful thinking had become reality. Hope had become real.\n\nThis undoubtedly was what Peter, James, and John experienced when they saw Jesus transformed before their very eyes. Since they had begun following Him, the disciples had heard Jesus speak about how God’s kingdom was not a distant hope but a current reality. They had seen extraordinary evidence of God’s kingdom in the miracles of Jesus. But they’d also seen the continued oppression by the Romans, the persistent hostilities from the religious leaders, and the unrelenting plight of the poor. What Jesus was saying sounded great, but what if it had been just wishful thinking, lacking any foundation in the real world?\n\nBut here they are, high on a mountain, encountering the glory of God alongside two of Israel’s greatest heroes, Moses and Elijah. Yet, shining radiant light like the Ancient of Days (Daniel 7:9), Jesus stands tall above these prophets. On that mountain, there was no question which man was the center of God’s redemptive activities. God Himself would confirm the obvious as “a cloud appeared, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my beloved Son; listen to him!” (Mark 9:7). Moses and Elijah may have played vital roles in preparing the way for God’s kingdom, but Jesus is the one who came to finish the job. The world that Jesus was unveiling through His words and actions was not wishful thinking. It was an authentic reality.\n\nIn many seasons of life, it can be difficult to believe that God’s kingdom is anything more than a pipe dream. When faced with a troubling diagnosis, financial stress, loneliness, or any other difficulty, the reality of a life where “death will be no more; grief, crying, and pain will be no more” (Revelation 21:4) can certainly seem outside the bounds of the real world. Most of us will not experience anything as dramatic as what the disciples were afforded in order to convince us of the reality of God’s kingdom. But we are called to do what the voice from heaven said: Listen to Jesus because He is the one who is making this world a reality. As we learn to listen, the truth of God’s kingdom will become more visible in our lives, and we’ll be strengthened for what lies ahead, as our hope is transformed into reality.",

		"devo_summary": "By Matt Capps\n\nImagine if you had lived in the time of Jesus and had heard of all the things He had said and done. You might be tempted to ignore the reports as if those spreading the news were liars or lunatics. You might think, These stories are neat and all, but what does this distant Jesus have to do with me?\n\nNow, imagine that Jesus came near to your town. Out of curiosity, you travel to meet Him. After hearing what He says and watching what He does, your curiosity moves from a place of abstract interest to personal investment. One of the things that the Gospel of Mark shows us is that when one is confronted with the person of Jesus Christ, there is no room for indifference.\n\nThe entire first half of Mark’s Gospel drives toward the question we find in Mark 8:29, “‘But you,’ he asked them, ‘who do you say that I am?’” This is a profoundly personal question. After all, Jesus is looking His followers in the eye, and the question cannot be ignored any longer. Jesus no longer exists as a topic of conversation, a story spread throughout your community; He exists in the flesh, in your very presence. But if you had followed Jesus for some time, you would have seen Him heal the sick, free those possessed by demons, and even raise the dead. After witnessing all this, you might conclude that He is certainly powerful.\n\nWhat does one do when Jesus performs miracles in situations that are not as dire, such as feeding a multitude? It’s likely that the people could have traveled to a nearby town to purchase food. But when Jesus feeds the crowds it demonstrates that He is not just a distant source of raw power. The feeding shows that His power comes with personal compassion. He is near, and He is meeting people’s most basic needs.\n\nPeople can easily ignore Jesus when, in their indifference, they relegate Him to a distant but powerful deity. If, however, you pay close attention to Jesus in the flesh, it becomes clear that He is not distant or detached, but near and neighborly. He is not only powerful, but also personally invested. He is not only capable of providing for our needs beyond our satisfaction; He is driven to do so by compassion in the face of our needs.\n\nWhen one honestly examines the things Jesus did and said, one must decide. The reports of Jesus do not come from liars and lunatics. Who do you say He is? He is certainly powerful. He is also personal, and sympathetic to the needs of those around Him. With all this in mind, it is clear: He is the Lord. He is the Savior that we have always longed for. His physical miracles in the Gospel accounts authenticate His message. And His message is the good news that He came to live a perfect life you and I could not, to die in our place for our sin, and resurrect to defeat death so that you and I could live eternally. When Jesus fed the crowds, their hunger was satisfied temporarily. However, there is a spiritual hunger in all of us that can only be satisfied in Him, the bread of life. Do you believe?",

The tomcat gets free just long enough to get inside and slams the door shut behind him. He starts locking it, and there are a lot of locks. Deadbolts, padlocks, chains, and keys, one after the other, down the whole door frame. Tom locks them all and bars the door. Then, for good measure, nails some boards over it. Finally safe, Tom relaxes. He takes a deep breath and turns around—and there’s Spike. The scene goes dark as Tom realizes he has locked himself inside with the bulldog.\n\nThe Pharisees imagined they could keep sin out if they washed their hands and their bodies and cups and pitchers and couches. The ceremonies and restrictions in their diet were like locks on Tom’s door. That is how we are with our sin when we try to keep it at bay with piety, devotion, and church attendance. Jesus teaches the futility of this by giving us a biology lesson. Everything we eat passes right through. Meanwhile, from our hearts, a litany of evil. The call is coming from inside the house. We are Trojans manning the walls after the horse is already inside the gates.\n\nWe are locked inside with our sin and can only pray with David, “God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me” (Psalm 51:10). The gospel gives us the answer. While our hearts overflow with incurable deceit, Jesus could not even stop the crowds from proclaiming how good He was. “They were extremely astonished and said, ‘He has done everything well’” (Mark 7:37).\n\nThis is a deeply incarnational moment in the Gospels. The body is center-stage. Hands, tongue, stomach, ears, fingers. We see the gritty, messy details of embodied life. Jesus spits. Dirty hands are mistaken for evil hearts. And in contrast, God reveals what goodness looks like—a person who can astonish everyone with how well He lives. In a person who overflowed with goodness, God unlocked the doors of our hearts and healed.\n\nThe Pharisees and scribes and crowds were all trapped inside with their sin. Custom, ceremony, and tradition were padlocks, chains, and deadbolts. They boasted in human doctrine, so Jesus reminded them of hypocrites’ vain worship which “honors me with their lips” (Mark 7:6). Then Mark shows us a man whose lips struggle to speak. Jesus placed a dusty hand on his tongue and the man spoke clearly. Jesus opened his ears to “hear joy and gladness” (Psalm 51:8). He came into the world to offer the same to us.",

		"devo_summary": "By Nick Batzig\n\nIn fear, we all struggle with a desire to control the events of our lives. But though the things that trouble our hearts and minds may feel unique to us, they are actually common among all humanity. Consider the disciples. They were fishermen, experienced in navigating the seas in order to ensure their livelihood. But they, too, experienced fear in the middle of the storm when they realized they had no real mastery over the waters.\n\nThese disciples had just witnessed Jesus’s miraculous feeding of the multitudes (Mark 6:30–44). Through this miracle, Jesus was showing them that He is our provider, “the bread of life” (John 6:35). He could’ve brought bread down from heaven (vv.32–33), but instead, He chose to work through the existing resources of His disciples in order to feed thousands (Mark 6:38–44).\n\nJesus then sent the disciples back to the boat in order to cross over to the other side, and He went to pray by Himself (Mark 6:45–46). While in the boat, the weather had become tumultuous. And in the middle of the night, Jesus “saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them” (v.48). After witnessing a miraculous provision, the disciples found themselves in the midst of stormy seas, cold and wet and fearful. How quickly they’d forgotten who Jesus is and what He can do!\n\nMark then records how, “very early in the morning [Jesus] came toward them walking on the sea wanting to pass by them” (Mark 6:48). When the disciples first saw Him, they were afraid. But Jesus assuaged their fears and told them, “Have courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid” (v.50). Jesus took the opportunity to show them that, apart from Him, they had no real mastery over the water. And by walking on the water at the height of a storm, He allayed their fear and displayed His authority, teaching them there is someone truly in control of even the most tumultuous of seas. There is someone more powerful than any circumstance that produced fear in their hearts.\n\nOf this strange encounter with His disciples, J.C. Ryle, an Anglican writer and preacher, writes, “Our Lord sees the troubles of His believing people, and in due time will help them.” This is the eternal Son of God, who came into the world to save sinners. As His disciples today, we can’t miss the central importance of knowing Him and His divine power. Whenever we are afraid, we need to listen to the words of the One who walked on water, the One who calmed the seas and the troubled hearts of His disciples. He is the same powerful Christ today.",

And who is the first person they encounter? Quite possibly a man as despicable as a God-fearing Jew could imagine. In the Jewish mind, pigs and graves were defiling things, which makes the man who rushes out to meet Jesus as unclean as one could get.\n\nBut we immediately recognize that there is more to it than that. Mark, who usually relays his stories at a quick pace, gives us an uncharacteristically detailed description of this man’s plight. He is captive to an evil and oppressive force that has left him in tatters. He is at the mercy of a power so formidable it is like the legions of Rome that brutalize any and all resistance they encounter. His neighbors, seeing the writing on the wall, tried to bind him in chains. There was simply no way to help this guy.\n\nEnter Jesus—the Messiah, the Son of God, the Davidic King who is announcing the arrival of God’s kingdom. What will happen when these two powers come face-to-face, the power that has come to restore humanity and the power bent on destroying it? And yet, the battle is over before it even begins. The oppressors surrender on sight, and King Jesus sends them, tails tucked between their legs and squealing in defeat, back to where they came.\n\nWithout question, the scriptures present a worldview that acknowledges a spiritual battle underlying the pain and injustice we see in the world. Knowing this, Mark records this story to remind us that Christ’s power to rescue, restore, and heal is far greater than any force of evil. In this instance, one man’s nightmare ended, but Jesus wasn’t finished. Like this unnamed man, Jesus Himself would be stripped naked, abandoned, and His flesh torn. In love, He would allow the “Legions” of the world to do their worst to Him so that He might take the full force of evil upon Himself and give people like us a new life, free from oppression.\n\nHow are we to respond to this unearned gift of freedom? Listen again to Christ’s instructions to the restored man: “Go home to your own people, and report to them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you” (Mark 5:19). Before, this man was living a broken existence. Now, he takes the light of Christ’s salvation to those who are lost in darkness. May we, who have been given new life in Jesus, go and do likewise.",

There is no denying that Jesus offers and calls us to a way of life directly in opposition to the way of the world and our own fleshly inclinations. Even our political ideologies, whatever they may be, test our allegiance to the cross; the tension found there leads us to sometimes draw connections to our faith where there is actually spiritual dissonance. We look to the world to support God’s Word, when we should really be looking to Jesus to reshape our lives and direct our steps here. How do we find clarity in the midst of so much confusion? We must start by listening to what God has to say about how we should live.\n\nIn Mark chapter 4, the word “hear” is used thirteen times. In one of His prolific speeches, Jesus outlines the work of the kingdom of God, saying that is comparable to sowing seeds. Jesus, in an effort to distinguish Himself from those who oppose Him (Mark 3), shares a parable to express His intentions for His forthcoming kingdom. The parable envisions different soils, different environments, where the seed of faith is left to grow: some places where the seed does not take root; some where seeds are taken away by birds; some with rocky soil where the seeds are choked by thistles and thorns; and some where the seed takes root and is nourished by good soil. Despite the variation in terrain, the seeds of faith that take root in good ground produce “fruit that increased, thirty, sixty and a hundred times” (Mark 4:8).\n\nThe parable begins with us listening and concludes with us hearing. What do we need to hear? The seed serves as a representation of the Word of God (Mark 4:13). The common denominator is that, despite the variation in terrain, the Word of God serves as the most important component. Because the Word of God is the essential tool for spiritual growth, we are without excuse. Many times, we neglect to start because we are afraid of rejection and failures by our preconceived thoughts about the soil’s potential.\n\nThe seed parable explains that it is God’s Word that will sprout, multiply, and grow fruit. We must remove ourselves from the burden of transformation because transformation is God’s work. We plant seeds and then pray that “anyone who has ears to hear [would] listen” (Mark 4:9). The faithfulness of the sower displays the commitment to continuing to spread seeds, even amongst the varying terrains. We are called to be faithful wherever we are because we serve as undercover agents wherever we are. From the boardroom to the carpool line, we are to be found faithful sharing the Word of God.\n\nThe parable of the sower is coupled with the paradox of putting a light under a bushel. If we have been given the gift of illumination in the midst of darkness, we have the responsibility of sharing it with those who remain in the shadows. Just as the sower shares the seeds, Christ-followers are invited to illuminate every space we occupy. We are not the transformers, but we do bear the obligation of sharing the liberating and transformative witness of Jesus Christ. We are not measured by accomplishments and accolades, but being faithful to the One who has changed our lives comes with a responsibility to share the gospel with others.",

		"devo_summary": "By Barnabas Piper\n\nSome of my earliest memories are of Sunday school lessons featuring flannel graphs telling the stories of Jesus. I learned of His many miracles and knew His teaching, and this painted a patchy picture of Jesus to me. I didn’t connect Jesus’s actions and words with who He is as the Son of God and Savior of the world.\n\nYears later, I began to see the mission and identity of Jesus displayed in His miracles. It began to click with these words from Jesus in Mark 2:\n\n“‘But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins’—he told the paralytic— ‘I tell you: get up, take your mat, and go home’” (Mark 2:10–11).\n\nJesus was not merely doing a nice thing for a paralyzed man with very persistent friends. Nor was His declaration of forgiven sins some disconnected statement. His power to heal and to forgive are the same power. His words declare His authority and demonstrate His purpose: to make the world whole. This physical healing was tied to healing of the soul.\n\nA few verses later, we see how the Pharisees were offended by Jesus’s tendency to keep company with the “extra” sinful. His response to them once again magnifies His mission to heal and make whole: “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners” (Mark 2:17). Jesus healed physical ailments and filled hungry bellies, proving that He is the Great Physician of sinners, both body and soul.\n\nNo one is righteous enough to not need Jesus. Some of us think we are too healthy for the doctor—the Pharisees certainly did. But Jesus is saying that in order to be forgiven, to be healed, they must admit their need. The paralytic man and his friends knew their need, as did the man with the withered hand (Mark 3:1). To them, Jesus gave forgiveness and healing. All we need is to see just how much we need Jesus, and then seek His forgiveness.\n\nWhen Jesus’s mother and brothers came to see Him, He didn’t prioritize them over the crowd He was caring for. Instead, He told the crowd, “Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35). Was He demeaning His family? No! He was opening the family doors wide to accept all who admit their need and submit to follow Him. “The one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters” (Hebrews 2:11). Jesus came for the spiritually sick, which is to say all of us who would lay down our pride, trust Him, and claim the righteousness He came to give us as our own.\n\n ",

		"devo_summary": "By Russ Ramsey\n\nScripture Reading: Mark 1:1-45, Nahum 1:15, Malachi 3:1\n\nJesus’s first words in Mark’s Gospel are a call to repent. He says, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!” (Mark 1:15).\n\nThis is an audacious thing to say, if you think about it. Jesus is essentially saying all of history has been waiting for Him, and He’s wrapping His arms around all of humanity, saying, “The kingdom of God has stepped into your world in the form of a man. What you have needed has come, and that’s me.”\n\nThen Jesus issues a two-fold call: “Repent and believe the good news.” Literally, the term “good news” means “information that brings great joy.” The implication here is that Jesus’s message should draw from us a response of joyful belief. This is a different kind of call than you’ll find in any other religion—including the religion of unbelief. Why? Because Christianity isn’t merely advice for how to live a good life. It is news of something that has happened. A kingdom has come.\n\nNotice how Jesus joins His call to believe the gospel with a call to repent. What a juxtaposition! The good news that the kingdom of God has come near calls us to recognize that we have reason to admit fault, confess sin and brokenness, and reverse course. The gospel is a liberating insult to our pride. What Jesus is saying is that there is no other way to find the life we were made to live outside of a relationship with God, and the only way to heal that relationship, which is broken, is through faith in Christ.\n\nJesus’s call to repent is a call to recognize that the path we’re on is the wrong path, and we need to turn from it. But it’s not a spiteful or shaming call. It is a loving call. Jesus calls us to forsake all other paths and follow Him. In this call to repent lies great joy and life because He isn’t just calling us out of a life we weren’t meant to live. He is calling us into the life we were meant for since the beginning. On that basis, it is a call into joy.\n\nThere is a life you were made for. You were meant to live in right relationship with your Maker. The call to repent is the call to examine your heart before God and enter into the joy being restored. The call to repent is always a call into joy.\n\nWritten by Russ Ramsey",
